        "Angelina Jolie called for a divorce from Brad Pitt. Would she call the divorce off, too? We\u2019ve learned EXCLUSIVELY that there\u2019s one reason that Angelina would welcome Brad back with open arms.  Hope may not be lost after all for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt\u2018s marriage. While they are firmly split and on their way to an official divorce, a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Angelina changing her mind could still be a possibility! She and Brad, and their family, have been through so much after breaking up nearly one year ago. But there\u2019s still love there, and it\u2019s up to Brad to make her feel it again!  \u201cAngelina definitely has regrets about splitting from Brad and about the end of their marriage. At the time of the breakup things were really bad between them \u2014 they had been fighting a lot \u2014 and she felt that Brad had checked out of their relationship,\u201d a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cObviously, there was a lot of drama surrounding the split, and bad feelings on both sides. Angelina misses Brad a lot more than she ever thought she would. She feels really lonely without him. Brad was Angelina\u2019s best friend, as well as her husband. They talked about everything and totally had each other\u2019s back. Angelina is a really stubborn person, and there\u2019s no way she would admit to having made a mistake, but if Brad came crawling back to her and begged for another chance, she would willingly drop the divorce.\u201d  Could it happen? Could we really see the rise and fall, and rise of Brangelina again in our lifetime? Angelina\u2019s already made it clear that she\u2019s pleased with the progress Brad\u2019s made in his sobriety. But Brad allegedly isn\u2019t too thrilled with the prospect of making up, according to a report from Life & Style. And on their wedding anniversary, August 23, they gave each other the silent treatment, we learned EXCLUSIVELY. They didn\u2019t want to ruminate on the sad day.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina\u2019s rep for comment.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina and Brad could make it work? Let us know!",
        "Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fianc\u00e9 Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.  \u201cIt was just perfect,\u201d Bischoff tells PEOPLE. \u201cI was completely shocked. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn\u2019t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!\u201d  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (\u201cLadies pick \u2014 finally it was my choice,\u201d jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  \u201cOn our first date, we just clicked,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was easy and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d  Still, Bischoff admits it was \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. \u201cI was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.\u201d  Bischoff hasn\u2019t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. \u201cI hope that he meets someone, if he hasn\u2019t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.\u201d  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she\u2019s moved on from her own reality show past. \u201cThat journey was a big part of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cBut since I\u2019ve met Ricky, I really haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn\u2019t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.\u201d",

        "Three years after announcing their separation and more than a year after filing for divorce, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are still legally married \u2014 and they may be that way for a while if they don\u2019t act fast.  LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  \u201cIf you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,\u201d the document states.  It\u2019s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  \u201cWe are definitely a modern family. We\u2019re doing really well,\u201d Garner said previously. \u201cIt has to be [children first]. You have no choice.

        "They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan\u2019s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary m\u00e9lange including the archbishop of Canterbury and \u2014 in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places \u2014 the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry\u2019s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry\u2019s life since his mother\u2019s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: \u201cArise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle\u2019s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle\u2019s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller\u2019s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman\u2019s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings \u2014 and certainly unlike Kate and William\u2019s wedding, just seven years ago \u2014 the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It\u2019s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William\u2019s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests \u2014 even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards \u2014 because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it\u2019s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry\u2019s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George\u2019s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kate Middleton\u2019s parents, Carole and Michael, were there. They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing. There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Diana\u2019s brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sister\u2019s death. It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train). David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.",

The No Doubt singer took to Instagram to share a picture of her country singer beau kissing her cheek.  The loved-up snap is a clear message that their relationship is still on - after claims she was dumped over \"jealousy and drama\" to do with her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale.  \"Blake\u2019s through with Gwen\u2019s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,\" a source told In Touch Weekly .  \u201cShe told him she didn\u2019t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.\"  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  (Image: GC Images)  (Image: Instagram)  The source added: \"Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the month-long Country Freaks Tour without her,\" said the source.  \"Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.\"  Mirror Online has contacted Gwen's representative for comment.  Last year, her ex-husband Gavin revealed that he and Gwen went through \"so much counselling\" in a bid to save their marriage.

Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she\u2019s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate \u2014 check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles\u2026and it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s historic mansion, and now, she\u2019s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil\u2019s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There\u2019s tons of space for the six kids, too \u2014 the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she\u2019s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie\u2019s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she\u2019s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane \u2014 check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina\u2019s new house? Do you think she\u2019s prepping for a wedding?",

        "Getty  According to the publication bombshell report, both duchesses, 36, are preparing to raise the royal cousins as part of 'one big, happy family.'  An insider said, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.  For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  In Touch  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.

Fitness enthusiast Meghan, whose mother Doria Ragland is a yoga instructor, is returning the favour by teaching Kate pregnancy yoga.  The publication adds that the two pregnant women are happily letting their husbands dote on them.  'William is doing his best to help Kate relax by being a hands-on father to George, Louis and Charlotte,' says the source.  'He brings Kate tea and cookies in bed,' including lavender biscuits which are known to help with nausea.  Getty  Kate, adds the source, is 'convinced she's having another girl because she's having the same cravings for sweets that she did when she was pregnant with Charlotte.'  Meghan is hoping for one of each - a boy and a girl - the insider tells In Touch.  'This is a dream come true for both couples.'  The royal family is yet to respond to In Touch's report.

        "California is \u201cthe darkest state in the Union,\u201d according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of \u201cBiblical disasters\u201d in recent times as punishment for \u201cembracing Satan and rejecting God.\u201d  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  \u201cCalifornia just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,\u201d the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton\u2019s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  \u201cPestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don\u2019t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can\u2019t even see what is right in front of their eyes.\u201d  \u201cFirst they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  \u201cThen they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!\u201c  \u201cAnd now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,\u201d Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey\u2019s house.  \u201cWhen they get hit with the \u2018Big One\u2018, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, \u201cthen we will know that the End Times have truly begun.\u201d  \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.\u201d  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn\u2019t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year\u2019s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.",

He's been through the wringer and always landed on his feet, which she admires.\"  Lohan and Affleck developed a friendship after the 45-year-old actor visited her in rehab back in 2013 to share his own struggles with alcoholism in a bid to inspire her to get sober whilst coping with the pressures fame.  If Lohan is going to be Batgirl then she is going to have to beat Emma Stone to the role, as she is currently believed to be the favourite for the Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Films project.  However, Whedon, 53, previously revealed he would like to cast an unknown actress as his leading lady.  Speaking about his casting process, he said: \"I doubt it will be a name.

        "Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.  Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's \"Dreamgirls,\" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  \"My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!\" she wrote.  \"Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,\" she added. \"You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.\"  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  \"I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,\" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in \"The Color Purple,\" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her \"Uncle Tom\" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  \"It just really made my heart drop to my feet,\" Holliday said. \"How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.\"  Holliday was to perform at the \"Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.",

The site also points out that Halle has only been on the NYC set for one day so far, which isn\u2019t much time to strike up a romance.  Meanwhile, Berry recently teased the movie\u2019s opening date on Instagram. She posted a note scrawled on paper from The Continental in NYC. The message said, \u201cSee you in a year, Mr. Wick,\u201d and included the caption, \u201cIt's a date. 5.17.19.\u201d  It's a date. 5.17.19 A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry) on May 21, 2018 at 8:59am PDT  In the movie, John Wick (Reeves) is on the run with a $14-million bounty on his head. Berry plays Sofia, an assassin who is likely hoping to cash in if she can catch him.",

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he\u2019s \u201cin touch with emotions and his true self like never before,\u201d the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. \u201cHe has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,\u201d the source adds. \u201cAnd while he\u2019s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he\u2019s seeing everything more clearly.\u201d  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would \u201cnever dream of\u201d ruining his ex\u2019s new marriage, he \u201cwould take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.\u201d  If they can\u2019t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt \u201cmuch happier\u201d following split from Angelina Jolie  \u201cThey worked well together\u201d when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. \u201cHe wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.\u201d  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on \u201cprestige projects\u201d under his production banner. \u201cShe\u2019d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress \u2014 something that\u2019s evaded both her and Angelina.\u201d  \u201cHe still considers Jen the love of his life,\u201d the source concluded.

Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  \u201cIt\u2019s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,\u201d Jackman revealed. \u201cThe first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks.

        "Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, but not everyone will be tuning in. Celebrities took to social media Friday morning to share their thoughts on the inauguration, and in some cases, suggested alternative viewing. Trump, who has not been particularly popular among the celebrity circuit, inspired a #Brownout from George Lopez. The comedian began the movement on Twitter in protest of Trump not appointing a Latino to his cabinet, which every president has done since 1988.

        "Celebrity  The Oscar-winning actor reportedly 'has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with [1 million dollar] in cash stuffed in a designer bag!'  Mar 24, 2017  AceShowbiz - George Clooney is reportedly under FBI investigation for alleged money laundering. National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor \"has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!\"  The publication claims that there's a \"hush-hush government investigation\" surrounding the \"Money Monster\" actor and \"the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it.\" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his \"generous nature,\" had a \"desire to spread the wealth.\" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, \"Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.\"  \"There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,\" the insider continued, before adding, \"But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag.\" The insider asserts, \"This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!\"  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any \"federal attention.\" A representative for the \"Ocean's Eleven\" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer \"is fabricated.\"",
        "Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye \u201cplan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.\"  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the \"Netflix and Chill Act?\" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says \"Kim is doing okay despite reports.\"  \"She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,\" the source continued. \"She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.\"  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .",

        "The current editor in chief of Vogue magazine, Anna Wintour, has a net worth of $35 million. In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.",

        "Rumour\u00ads sugges\u00adt so!  Uh oh! Looks like Reese Witherspoon is allegedly \u2018furious\u2019 with her long-time best friend Nicole Kidman.  New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star\u2019s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  \u201cReese is furious that Nicole hasn\u2019t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,\u201d Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies\u2018 debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones\u2018 first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it\u2019s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. \u201cYou could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,\u201d claimed the source.  News of the pair being involved in \u201csome tense arguments\u201d during filming were also reported by the publication, which alleged that the Hollywood heavyweights may never work together again.  An insider claimed, \u201cIf the show doesn\u2019t make any waves or get better ratings, it will probably mark the end of Reese and Nicole\u2019s joint ventures.\u201d  However, a representative of Daily Mail Australia says the story is completely incorrect. \u201cEveryone is thrilled to the back teeth with Big Little Lies. They\u2019re (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.\u201d  Another source has denied New Idea\u2019s claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a \u2018shed load\u2019 of publicity both in America and abroad. The report comes just two months after she spoke about the actresses\u2019 friendship in California. \u201cWe\u2019re very, very close friends. We\u2019re able to talk about everything,\u201d she said.  Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.  Read full story",

Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress.

In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a \"punk outsider,\"[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, \"I am still at heart\u2014and always will be\u2014just a punk kid with tattoos.\"[17] As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, \"For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.\"[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used \"just about every drug possible,\" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide\u2014at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, \"I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.\"[21] Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in",

It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' \u00a32million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There\u2019s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it\u2019s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. \u00a32.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry\u2019s boxes when it comes to privacy. There\u2019s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying \u00a32 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. \u00a34.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'. Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate. The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a \u00a35 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015. Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court. 'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says. Locals have spotted the Prince \u2014 without his girlfriend \u2014 discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months. The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs. \u00a37.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff \u2014 a must for any royal retreat 'I'm not surprised he's moving here \u2014 he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.' Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds. Harry's royal duties require him to be close to London and Toronto-based Meghan, whose time on the U.S. TV series Suits is coming to an end, wouldn't cope well with",

        "Some reports suggest Ben Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus' relationship may have been going on even while they were still married to their respective spouses. A source tells ET that Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller -- a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. According to the source, Affleck and Shookus were seeing one another as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that he had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says. However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015. WATCH: 6 Things We Know About Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus Let's take a look back at Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship timeline. 2013: According to People, Affleck and Shookus started seeing one another in 2013, two years before Affleck and 45-year-old Garner announced their separation. Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013. Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took \"work.\" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss. One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. \"He definitely looked interested in her,\" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar. Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus \"full-on had an affair,\" claims a source cited by People. \"They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide.\" \"Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,\" claims a second source the magazine quotes. \"Both of them were cheating on their spouses so they were very careful about it,\" the source alleges. X17online.com According to Us Weekly, the romance began just a few months after Shookus became a mom to her daughter with Miller. \"[Affleck and Shookus] were sleeping together, sending each other cute texts and meeting up whenever they could,\" an insider close to Garner and Affleck reportedly claims to the outlet. 2015: According to Us Weekly, Garner and Miller found out about the Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time in 2015. \"They were devastated when they found out about the affair,\" a source claims according to the magazine. However, a source close to Affleck tells Us Weekly, \"Lindsay was not what led to the end of their marriage. They had a ton of other problems.\" June 2015 -- Affleck and Garner separate Affleck and Garner announced their split on June 30, 2015. \"After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,\" the two said in their joint statement to ET. \"We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.\" July 2015 -- The nanny scandal Us Weekly broke the story on July 29, claiming that Affleck had secretly been dating Ouzounian, and that the two frequently texted and emailed after she was let go as his children's nanny. Earlier that month, Ouzounian tipped off the paparazzi, telling them she'd be at the L.A.-area rental house that Affleck was staying in at the time, a source later told ET. The former nanny was seen smiling wide as she handed Affleck a bottle of champagne during their late-night meetup. She also arrived at Affleck's in his Lexus, which she had also been seen driving earlier in the day while running errands. Affleck's rep slammed the reports, telling ET that \"all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue\" and that they are considering legal options. \"The story is complete garbage and full of lies,\" his rep stated. April 2017 -- Garner and Affleck officially file for divorce Affleck and Garner legally filed for divorce in April 2017, after a two-year separation. Still, the pair have made it clear that their three children -- Violet, Seraphina and Samuel -- remain their priority. Just one month earlier, Affleck thanked Garner for her support after announcing that he had just completed treatment for alcohol addiction. \"I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,\" he wrote in his statement on Facebook. July 2017 -- Affleck steps out with Shookus Affleck was photographed with Shookus for the first time on July 6, when the two had dinner at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Los Angeles. A source tells ET that Affleck's new relationship works \"really well,\" because Shookus \"has had experience with the Hollywood world.\" \"[She] knows what is expected of Ben, and how much of their relationship they can share publicly,\" the source explains. \"It puts Ben at ease knowing that Lindsay understands who he is. They have kept their relationship very low key and private.\" Another source also tells ET that much like Affleck and Garner, Shookus and her ex -- whom she married in 2010 -- are also \"extremely amicable.\" \"They live separately but",

She\u2019s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  \u201cShe feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,\u201d InTouch\u2019s insider says. \u201cWho knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they\u2019ll definitely be in a better place.\u201d  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we\u2019re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt.

        "His sweet escape. Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for getting him back on his feet following his divorce from Miranda Lambert. The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The \u201cMisery\u201d singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  \u201cI won\u2019t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen \u2014 who I didn\u2019t really know \u2014 and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, \u2018Wow, she feels super bad for me!\u2019\u201d Shelton recalled. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me much, because we didn\u2019t know each other at the time, but she said, \u2018I\u2019m going through something very similar to what you\u2019re going through. I understand. And I hate it.\u2019\u201d  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children\u2019s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The \u201cCame Here to Forget\u201d singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email \u2014 \u2018This s\u2013t happened to me, what happened to you?\u2019 \u2014 to maybe three times a week, then every day, to \u2018Hey, here\u2019s my phone number if you ever want to text,\u2019\u201d Shelton told Billboard. \u201cNext thing I know, I wake up and she\u2019s all I care about, and I\u2019m \u00adwondering if she feels the same about me.\u201d  \u201cGwen saved my life,\u201d he added. \u201cWho else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can\u2019t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.\u201d  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, \u201cGo Ahead and Break My Heart,\u201d on his 12th studio album, If I\u2019m Honest.  \u201cWhen we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,\u201d Shelton said of his split from Lambert. \u201cWhen you have a broken heart \u2014 at least, when I do \u2014 you got to get it out of your system.

        "The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29] To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK \u00a35 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31] Wedding [ edit ] Planning [ edit ] Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST. Venue [ edit ] The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36] Cost [ edit ] The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be \u00a350,000, \u00a3110,000, and \u00a3286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around \u00a332 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent \u00a32.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to \u00a3500 million.[41] Wedding attire [ edit ] The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of \"Dress Uniform, Morning Coat",
        "CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY \u2013 President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party \u2013 and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. \"What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?\" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. \"Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?\" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't \"know all the facts\" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY \"I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,\" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists \u2013 a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. \"We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: \"There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.\u201d Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: \"Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no.\" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump \"must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN.\" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding \"many sides\" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response \"fine\" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. \"There was no way of making a correct statement that early,\" he said at one point. \"I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters \u2013 I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts.\" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday \u2013 for condemning \"the leftist terrorists\" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump defends his decision to delay responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY Trump also said \"not all of those people\" who attended the demonstration were not racist or neo-Nazi, but only wanted to protest the city's plans to remove the Robert E. Lee statue. That statement also drew catcalls from Republicans. \"If you're showing up to a Klan rally, you're probably a racist or a bigot,\" said Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., said on CNN. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that \"the organizers of events\" that led to the Charlottesville terror attack \"are 100% to blame.\" The white supremacists, Rubio tweeted, are \"adherents of an evil ideology which argues certain people are inferior because of race, ethnicity or nation of origin.... When (there's an) entire movement built on anger and hatred towards people different than you, it justifies and ultimately leads to violence against them.\" Rubio offered a direct message to Trump: \"Mr. President, you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame... (they) will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win. We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected.\" More: Trump distances himself from strategist Steve Bannon in wake of Charlottesville violence The president was slated to only discuss infrastructure during his appearances, but took questions from reporters for more than 15 minutes, most of them about Charlottesville. Some aides looked dismayed as he answered more questions. During a rollicking, impromptu news conference in which Trump and reporters frequently argued and interrupted each other, the president also: Questioned moves by local government to remove Confederate statues and monuments from public places Trump openly wondered whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are at risk because they were slave owners. \"You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\" Trump said. On the other hand, Trump said local governments are free to make their own decisions on these issues.

        "Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter \"The New Marguerite\", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House \"a great misfortune will strike\". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daa\u00e9 and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom\u00b4s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song \"Learn to Be Lonely\" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story \"Angels of Music\" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.",

And Lindsay Lohan certainly looked the part as she attended a London Modest Fashion Week event in the capital on Sunday. The American Mean Girls actress, 31, opted to wear a hijab for the event, conforming to the event's theme- which showcases the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines. Letting a glimpse of her trademark flame hair shine through, the head piece perfectly framed her pretty face, accentuated by a touch of lipgloss and eyebrow pencil. She teamed it with a black bomber jacket and black trousers as she stopped to check out the cosmetics. The actress was seen posing with excited fans at the event, before making a quiet exit. Sharing a snap of the actress with their goodie bag, a beauty brand from the event later wrote: 'She was so lovely and was saying how she's into halal cosmetics and what she\u2019s actually wearing on her face today was all halal!!'

Running alongside London Fashion week, the event, which charges up to \u00a3200 for tickets, features shopping, runway shows, talks and workshops - including a 'sharia legal hub'.

A new angle: London Modest Fashion week kicked off this weekend, running alongside London Fashion week The Arabic greeting translates to 'and unto you peace,' and many took it mean that Lohan was converting to the Muslim faith. Lohan has not revealed however if she is in fact converting to the faith, and a rep for the actress did not respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. There were previously rumors that Lohan might be converting back in 2015 when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran while doing community service in Brooklyn. When appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the book was actually just a gift from some friends. 'My very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Quran and I brought it to New York because I was learning,' said Lohan. Rare picture: In January Lindsay deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio, changing her bio to 'Alaikum salam.' (seen in her latest new Instagram post) 'It opened doors for me to experience spiritually, to find another true meaning. This is who I am.' She said however that she was attacked after that picture was released in the media. 'They crucified me for it in America. They made me seem like Satan. I was a bad person for holding that Quran,' said Lohan. She said that she was then happy to leave and return to London because she felt unsafe in [her] country. Lohan spent time in October of last year visiting child refugees who had fled Syria and crossed over into Turkey. She told Page Six last month that she was hoping to return to Turkey again either before of after the start of the new year. 'The dates are not set yet. It depends on how Turkey feels after the recent terrorist attack in Istanbul,' said Lohan, 'Not that any attack has or will ever stop me from helping those suffering, those who need our help the most.' She then added: 'I miss my family a lot, but they are very supportive and understanding of the fact that my main focus is business, writing and soon to start another film. More so, my work with refugees.' Just a few days before her account was wiped clean in January 2017, Lindsay had shared a poem in which she said she wanted to 'fix ISIS minds'. 'Sometimes I hear the voice of the one I loved the most. But in this world we live in on terror,' the poem went. 'Who i am to be the girl who is scared and hurt, when most things that happen i cannot explain. 'I try to understand, when i'm sitting in bed alone at 3am. So i can't sleep, i roll over. I can't think and my body becomes cold. I immediately feel older..... 'Than [sic] i realize, at least I am in a bed. I am still alive. So what can really be said? Just go to bed and close the blinds. 'Still and son on, i cannot help but want to fix all of these idle isis minds because, there",

        "Kim Kardashian sat down for an extensive interview with Ellen DeGeneres on Monday, April 30.  Among the many topics discussed between host and ex-sex tape star, of course, was the dishonesty and infidelity of Tristan Thompson.  As previously cited, Kardashian said simply that Thompson cheating on sister Khloe Kardashian was just so \"f-cked up,\" a term she apologized for using on air.  But an appropriate term nonetheless, right?  Elsewhere in this sit-down, Kim described the entire situation as \"sad,\" while not exactly answering Ellen directly when asked if she EVER liked Thompson.  Instead, she rambled on about how Khloe often \"dives in\" to romances and the family supports her as best they can.  Interesting, right?  As for other subjects touched on in this semi-revealing Q&A?  Kim wanted to initially name her third child Jo or Grace.  Kanye played the game Connect 4 during Chicago's delivery. (In his defense, Kim was not the one doing the delivering; they used a surrogate.)  \"The second she came out, any fear that I had of, 'Will I not have this connection? Will she not look like me?' all of that goes out the door, and instantly, she's ours,\" Kim of watching a surrogate birth Chicago.  \"It's such a good feeling.\"  Saint has an \"amazing vocabulary\" and may be a genius.  North has been \"better\" with Chicago than she was with Saint when he was first born but that Saint is still the \"nicer\" one.\"  Yes, despite photo evidence to the contrary at times, Kanye West is a happy person.

        "Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens. According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato\u2019s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality\u2013 despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Demi Lovato\u2019s sexuality: 1.

The bad news is that it isn't me. \u2014 ste(screeching into the wilderness)ph (@stphfrndz) September 11, 2017 2. She\u2019s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song \u201cCatch Me\u201d on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley\u2019s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed \u201cBFF,\u201d in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70\u2019s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn\u2019t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that\u2019s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He\u2019s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he\u2019s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I\u2019ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato\u2019s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme \u201cBomba\u201d Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato \u2018Hooked Up\u2019 in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. \u201cI\u2019m like the one person demi has slept with that didn\u2019t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,\u201d Rose tweeted out. She went on to say \u201cThink ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato\u2019s friends attack me for being a \u2018scorned ex-lover\u2019 get over it! I liked the hair.\u201d Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. \u201cRumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.\u201d The singer added \u201cWhether there\u2019s been rumours with one specific person or not, that\u2019s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.\u201d 4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is \u201cpresented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.\u201d The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. \u201cDemi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,\u201d said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. \u201cShe is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.\u201d During her acceptance speech, Lovato said \u201cYou should always love yourself for who you are,\u201d she said. \u201cThe skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it. You can do it!\u201d Watch the full speech above. 5. She Said She\u2019s Not \u2018Denying\u2019 or \u2018Confirming\u2019 Her Sexuality Lovato\u2019s 2015 single \u201cCool for the Summer\u201d had many fans wondering whether or not this was her coy way of speaking on her sexuality. The lyrics \u201cTell me what you want, what you like, it\u2019s ok / I\u2019m a little curious, too\u201d and \u201cGot a taste for the cherry / I just need",

        "Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History \u2013 despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump\u2019s products weren\u2019t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter\u2019s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump\u2019s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst\u2019s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 \u2014 the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump\u2019s clothing and jewelry line on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff is what I would tell you,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI\u2019m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.\u201d And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump\u2019s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that \u201cthe beginning of February\u201d shows \u201cthe best performing weeks in the history of the brand.\u201d \u201cFor several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,\u201d Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst\u2019s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter\u2019s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was \u201clargely featured\u201d in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had \u201cbeen treated so unfairly\u201d by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. \u201cIt would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,\u201d Tanner said of Conway\u2019s Fox interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.\u201d Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely wrong, wrong, wrong\u201d and \u201cclearly over the line,\u201d The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been \u201ccounseled.\u201d But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government\u2019s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post\u2019s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president\u2019s deputy counsel. \u201cWhen an employee\u2019s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,\u201d Shaub wrote. \u201cNot taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.\u201d [A Trump voter\u2019s message to retailers: \u2018Keep your mouths shut about our president\u2019] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway \u2014 a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar \u2014 partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump\u2019s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen such a large uptick,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cTypically, she\u2019s not in our top 100 sellers.\u201d Comparing February\u2019s numbers with last year\u2019s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company\u2019s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.

In a simple post on her personal app on Friday, Kim simply listed the name \u201cChicago West\u201d as the new moniker for their baby girl. The name can be interpreted as a sweet tribute to the city that Kanye grew up in and references frequently and lovingly in his music.  Chicago, who was born on Monday via surrogate, is the third child for Kim and Kanye, who already have a daughter, 4-year-old North and a son, 2-year-old Saint.

        "No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  \u201cI do believe in marriage,\u201d the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. \u201cAnd I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I\u2019m not forcing anything right now.\u201d  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other\u2019s lives in a way that most other people couldn\u2019t.\u201d  She added: \u201cWe both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.\u201d  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single \u201cUs\u201d written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for one year today. I don\u2019t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song\u2019s for you. I love you,\u201d she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: \u201cThey played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, \u2018Oh, this is relevant!\u2019 Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, \u2018Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?\u2019\u201d  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the \u201cDance Again\u201d songstress\u2019 life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. \u201cWhen I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cI know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I\u2019m glad I can do that now.\u201d  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. \u201cBaseball is just like life,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you want to do is hit a home run.\u201d  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",
        "Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years \u2014 not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world\u2019s most famous \u201cunsinkable\u201d ship \u2014 which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people \u2014 is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer \u2014 not J. Bruce Ismay \u2014 is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  \u201cThe new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you\u2019d expect on a 21st-century ship,\u201d James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer\u2019s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers \u2014 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers \u2014 from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers\u2019 relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets \u2014 with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.",

        "The pair became close friends on set when they filmed Netflix show Maniac and Jen is said to be wondering whether they have been dating while she and Justin were still a couple.  \u2018Justin and Emma did a movie together last year, so Jen is of course now wondering whether they hooked up back then - when Justin and Jen were still married,\u2019 spills the source.  \u2018It\u2019s certainly not the first time Jen\u2019s seen her husband fall for another actress on set, so of course she\u2019s wary.

        "Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.

The company\u2019s \u201cVerified Fan\u201d program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents\u2019 credit card numbers.

The series revolves around seventeen year old high school student, Clay Jensen, and his deceased female friend Hannah Baker, who has committed suicide after failing to cope with the culture, gossip and lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners. Dylan Minnette stars as Clay, while Katherine Langford plays Hannah. Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James also star. A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah. Throughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device. Cast and characters [ edit ] Main [ edit ] Recurring [ edit ] Introduced in season one [ edit ] Josh Hamilton as Matt Jensen, Clay's father, a psychologist. Michele Selene Ang as Courtney Crimsen, a closeted student at Liberty High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah to protect the secret of her own sexual orientation. In season 2, she comes out on the stand during the trial of Hannah Baker, confessing her actions against Hannah that landed her on the tapes. Steven Silver as Marcus Cole, the self-centered student body president at Liberty High, who is responsible for humiliating and attempting to sexually assault Hannah on a date. In season 2, he is suspended from school after lying on the stand during the trial and following the leaked release of the tapes soon after. Ajiona Alexus as Sheri Holland, a student and cheerleader at Liberty High who forms a bond with Clay but is also on the tapes when her actions result in Jeff's accidental death. Tommy Dorfman as Ryan Shaver, a student at Liberty High who betrayed Hannah's trust. Sosie Bacon as Skye Miller, an estranged friend of Clay.

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: \"What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?\"  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: \"No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.\"  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: \"I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.\"  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: \"I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.\"  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members\u2019 club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.

        "There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the \"Wildest Dreams\" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, \u201cTaylor was so young when they dated, she wasn\u2019t ready for a serious relationship, but now she\u2019s showing Jake how much she\u2019s matured. She\u2019s excited to see where things go.\u201d  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, \u201cHe said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor\u2019s new number. They\u2019ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.\"  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  \u201cThis guy walks in who is a friend of my ex\u2019s and starts talking about how he\u2019s heard we\u2019re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together \u2014 just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, \u2018This is what we\u2019re writing,\u2019\u201d she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: \"I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.\"  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was \"no truth\" to the report.  Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.",

        "Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn\u2019t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton\u2019s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here\u2019s everything we know about Middleton\u2019s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton\u2019s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three \u2014 who gave birth to a second baby boy in April \u2014 is worth at least \u00a35 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as \u00a37.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton\u2019s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn\u2019t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton\u2019s net worth is a lot less than her prince \u2014 Wealth-X estimates Prince William\u2019s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William\u2019s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal \u2014 an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson\u2014Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton\u2019s money?  Most of Middleton\u2019s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around \u00a330 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least \u00a3250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew\u2019s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton\u2019s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth \u00a31 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson\u2014Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn\u2019t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family\u2019s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money \u2014 her net worth is believed to be about $5 million \u2014 as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the \u2018Kate effect\u2019?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as \u201cthe Kate Effect,\u201d ",

        "R. Kelly\u2019s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive \u201csex cult\u201d of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly\u2019s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would \u201cwork diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.\u201d) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of \u201cknowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.\u201d Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he \u201ccategorically denies all claims and allegations.\u201d As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there\u2019s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly\u2019s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he\u2019s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year\u2019s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a \u201cchild molester\u201d in an interview with Complex, insisting, \u201cHe pees on people.\u201d In our post-#MeToo, post-Time\u2019s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples\u2019s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, \u201cWe can\u2019t ever talk about this guy. ... You\u2019re about to get me fired from Coachella. It\u2019s my first time here.\u201d Later, Staples tweeted that \u201cR. Kelly people is looking for me.\u201d ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ \u2014 andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly\u2019s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: \u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a shitbag.\u201d In April, the Women of Color committee within Time\u2019s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly\u2019s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly\u2019s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It\u2019s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he\u2019s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that\u2019s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he\u2019s been accused of, how often he\u2019s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that\u2019s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. \u201cThe saddest fact I\u2019ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,\u201d says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. \u201cNobody.\u201d To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis\u2019s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis\u2019s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly\u2019s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I\u2019ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The \u201990s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. \u201cFamily members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate \u2018game,\u2019 and she just went along with it,\u201d the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly\u2019s assistant, using a fake ID. \u201cWithin hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.\u201d The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of \u201cemotional distress caused",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device 'I would hope that I would win against Serena'  Serena Williams disputes John McEnroe's claims that she would struggle to be in the world's top 700 if she was on the men's circuit.  But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: \"If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.\"  He qualified the comments by saying: \"That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.\"  But he added: \"I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.\"  Williams later responded on Twitter: \"Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  \"I've never played anyone ranked \"there\" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.\"  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was \"trying to talk women's tennis down\" but said \"the reality\" was that \"men are stronger in general\".  \"I would hope that I would win against Serena,\" he added.  \"It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  \"It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  \"I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.\"  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.",
        "Mark Wahlberg has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days. The successful actor has an important message for anti-Trump celebrities.

        "What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA\u2019s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant\u2019s \u201celite\u201d patrons.  CANNIBALISM \u2018MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK\u2019  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that \u201cCannibalism is way more popular than you might think\u201d and \u201chuman flesh is the best meat\u201c, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the \u201ccutting edge of experimental cuisine\u201d and serves \u201cL.A.\u2019s cultural elite\u201c, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they \u201cspecialize in the preparation of human meat\u201d that comes from \u201cyoung and healthy bodies.\u201c  Cannibal Club\u2019s visiting chefs \u201chail from around the world\u201d and come to L.A. to \u201cpractice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,\u201d according to the Cannibal Club website.  \u2018FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES\u2019  \u201cOur exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  \u201cAt Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.\u201c  Describing each dish as a \u201cstudy in taste and elegance\u201c, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: \u201cThe meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.\u201d  But don\u2019t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  \u201cIt is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.\u201c  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (\u201ca Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver\u201c) and Placenta Lasagne (\u201can otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano\u201d.)  Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.  \u2018YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES\u2019  In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:  \u201cMost of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.\u201c  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness. Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as \u201cthe original fake news\u201c late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said \u201cHail Satan\u201d on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her \u201cearthly father\u201d, Billy R",
        "Is CAITLYN JENNER going into Celebrity Big Brother? by Hannah Mellin | 19 05 2017 Wowzas  Celebrity Big Brother are apparently willing to 'break the bank' in order to get Caitlyn Jenner on the next series of the show that's set to air later this year.

From \u201ccool pants\u201d to clover emojis, there\u2019s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events. Kanye West Dates Amber Rose In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris\u2019 \u201cWhat Them Girls Like\u201d music video. The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, \u201c[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn\u2019t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he\u2019s remorseful for how he treated me.\u201d Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. \u201cMost amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,\u201d Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna\u2019s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian\u2019s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West\u2019s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fianc\u00e9, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song \u201cCold\u201d in which he rapped, \u201cOnly n\u2014a I got respect for is Wiz / And I\u2019ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.\u201d Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter.

Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim\u2019s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim\u2019s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family\u2019s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He\u2019s stayed out of the public eye ever since. \u201cHe sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,\u201d Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. \u201cThere was no fight.\u201d Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. \u201cThey are trying to keep it amicable,\u201d an insider told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cThey also have a lot of friends in common \u2014 Tyga is Kanye [West\u2019s] boy and Blac Chyna got close to [his wife] Kim [Kardashian] \u2014 so they don\u2019t want to make it weird.\u201d Amber Rose Splits From Wiz Khalifa Despite previously saying she wanted to be with Khalifa \u201cfor the rest of my life,\u201d Rose filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after they tied the knot. \u201cI never knew what a true heartache felt like until now,\u201d Rose tweeted several weeks later. Tyga Starts Dating Kylie Jenner In the fall of 2014, Tyga and the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan sparked a series of dating rumors after they were seen hanging out together regularly. In August 2014, Tyga hosted Kylie Jenner\u2019s 17th birthday party, and they continued to be spotted out together as the months went on. However, due to Jenner\u2019s underage status, the couple never publicly acknowledged their romance. Amber Rose Slams Kylie Jenner and Tyga Fresh off her split from Khalifa, Rose befriended Chyna, who was now estranged from Kim after the Tyga/Kylie dating rumors. In February 2015, Rose appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she gave her unfiltered thoughts on Jenner\u2019s relationship with Tyga. \u201cShe\u2019s a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o\u2019clock and relax,\u201d Rose said of Jenner. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.

        "Selena Gomez thinks Charlie Puth\u2019s dating history disclosure was a mistake! A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com her reaction!  Selena Gomez, 25, is seriously wishing Charlie Puth, 26, didn\u2019t divulge their former relationship. A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY gave us the deets about how Selena reacted to Charlie\u2019s confirmation that they dated. \u201cSelena wishes Charlie would have kept his mouth shut about what they had because she is definitely interested in keeping that kind of stuff and her dating life as much under wraps as possible,\u201d our source said. It\u2019s clear that when it comes to who she dates, Selena apparently is all about maintaining her privacy.  According to our source, it\u2019s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie\u2019s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item \u2014 and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. \u201cNow, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it\u2019s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,\u201d our source added. \u201cShe\u2019s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.\u201d We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games. While they arrived separately, the two of them definitely left together.  Time will tell if Charlie\u2019s big reveal will throw a wedge into Jelena\u2019s relationship, but all signs point to the two of them continuing to make it work in 2018.

        "Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we\u2019re talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice\u2019s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  \u201cTeresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe\u2019s deportation and she agreed to do it,\u201d an insider revealed. \u201cHalf a million dollars to share the story on camera.\u201d  And this story is believable because this isn\u2019t Teresa\u2019s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  \u201cIt is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,\u201d added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE\u2019S DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that \u201crecords show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.\u201d  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  \u201cTeresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,\u201d the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE \u2013 Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe\u2019s possible deportation.

'Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another,' the statement added.

The new parents are struggling to find quality time together as they juggle their busy careers and care for their 11-month-old son, Bear, the source told MailOnline.  A source has told MailOnline that Cheryl is spending a lot of time at home on her own with Bear because she would rather stay in watching soaps on TV than go out to showbiz parties.  Concerned fans have pointed out that the couple have not been pictured together for some time and were not photographed together on Valentine's Day.  Instead Liam posted an Instagram picture of Bear on Wednesday with the caption: 'Happy Valentine's Day @cherylofficial and everyone. Looks like I've got the big guy to compete with now.'  Cheryl Cole and Liam Payne's relationship is 'strained' as he is spending nights away from home while she looks after their baby son, a friend has claimed  Cheryl and Liam are struggling to find quality time together as they juggle their busy careers and care for their 11-month-old son, Bear, the source told MailOnline  The post hid Bear's face but focused on his personalised babygro which read: 'Bear is Mummy's little Valentine.' Fans believed he had taken the picture.  Cheryl - who is living at their \u00a35.6million country home in Surrey - did not publicly respond to his message.  A source told MailOnline: 'Cheryl basically went into hibernation when she got pregnant and has made the decision to be a stay at home mother with no nanny and is looking after bear herself.

Fans of the couple are concerned that they haven't been pictured together since August  The last time they were seen in public was at The X Factor last October.  A friend Cheryl said: 'The fact of the matter is, like most young couple's with busy work lives and the demands of an infant they have been struggling to spend time together.  'There are the very real strains of trying to adapt to parenthood whilst being in the spotlight and having to appear as though everything is rosy all of the time.  'It is not real life and is not the life Cheryl and Liam are currently living as a couple.'  Cheryl has been supported by her brother Gary and his partner, who she has moved into Liam's home in Woking.

The source added: 'Cheryl just wants what every woman wants. A loving, happy family and someone to grow old with.  'There is no doubt she wants more children - but it is fair to say at the moment there is a lot of pressure on both her and Liam. Being apart isn't helping that.'  The couple's lack of public outings together has already puzzled fans. One tweeted: 'Hey @LiamPayne the last (time) you posted a selfie on Instagram with Cheryl was August last year.  Could you bless us with a new one please Liam. @CherylOfficial.' Another follower wrote: '@CherylOfficial hello, I miss your selfies with liam x'.

        "Joe Jonas soaked up the sun in Australia with a group of beautiful women, but none of them were Sophie Turner! Why is he hanging out with all of these gorgeous girls?  Joe Jonas looks like he\u2019s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 \u2014 but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don\u2019t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The \u201cCake By The Ocean\u201d singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe\u2019s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie\u2019s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe\u2019s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe\u2019s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, \u201cHappy Birthday @sophiet You\u2019re super cool! We all think so!\u201d Aww, it\u2019s like she\u2019s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn\u2019t mind her fianc\u00e9 posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to \u201c22\u201d by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn\u2019t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest \u2014 nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there\u2019s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer\u2019s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME\u2018s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we\u2019re sure Joe knows that!  HollywoodLifers, are you sad that Sophie isn\u2019t in Australia with Joe?",
        "Justin Bieber\u2019s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she\u2019s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here\u2019s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She\u2019s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can\u2019t be said for Bieber. \u201cJustin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,\u201d a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.\u201d  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he\u2019s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. \u201cHe can\u2019t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,\u201d the insider reveals. It\u2019s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she \u201cchose\u201d to take care of herself, \u201cnot to prove anything to anyone.\u201d Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn\u2019t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He\u2019s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year\u2019s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber\u2019s birthday on March 1, according to reports.",
        "Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He\u2019s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it\u2019s all said and done. On Liam\u2019s first single, \u201cStrip That Down,\u201d he\u2019s dissed One Direction plain as day. \u201cYou know I used to be in 1D, now I\u2019m out free,\u201d he sings. \u201cPeople want me for one thing, that\u2019s not me. I\u2019m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.\u201d    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan\u2019s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s not my sort of music. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d listen to,\u201d he said. But he did have a quick save: \u201cI think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That\u2019s the way I\u2019d put it best, I think.\u201d Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn\u2019t listen to hip-hop. \u201cMy song\u2019s more \u2018Rack City\u2019 and his song is more of a different era to something I\u2019d listen to, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cStrip That Down\u201d does feature a rapper, Migos\u2019s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.",
        "Now, it\u2019s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year\u2019s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use \u201cunseen footage we shot together in Episode VII\u201d and assuring fans that \u201cwe were never going to recast, or use a CG character.\u201d While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher \u2014 or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa \u2014 will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia\u2019s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can\u2019t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there\u2019s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D\u2019Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she\u2019s very much in \u201charried leader\u201d mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we\u2019ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It\u2019s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams\u2019 comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that\u2019s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they\u2019ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm \u2014 and Fisher\u2019s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams\u2019 statement \u2014 want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they\u2019re courting backlash if this isn\u2019t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It\u2019s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology \u2014 and loved Fisher as a person \u2014 as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.",

        "Caitlyn Jenner is putting her foot down and has refused to watch Megyn Kelly\u2019s highly anticipated interview with the Kardashian and Jenner clans that is set to air in June.  Last week, pictures surfaced on TMZ that showed Mrs. Kelly, the new face of NBC, on the Los Angeles set of \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d after conducting a lengthy interview with Kris Jenner and all of her daughters \u2013 Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kourtney, Kim, and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.

As for Kanye West being absent, no explanation was given \u2013 as the saying goes, Kanye does what Kanye wants.  The retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, who is currently promoting her new memoir, \u201cThe Secrets of My Life,\u201d is embroiled in a nasty fight with ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and is said to be allergic to all things Kardashian.

The person revealed: \u201cShe\u2019s hoping her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, were able to persuade their mother not to discuss Caitlyn in-depth.Caitlyn thinks is awful that Kris is basically calling her a liar and possibly damaging her relationship with the girls.\u201d  Kourt looking for zero fucks to give on her 38th bday looking soooo good A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Apr 18, 2017 at 7:34pm PDT  On the April 28th episode of \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d Kim slammed Caitlyn for attacking her family in her new memoir and for insulting her mother.

        "I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in \u201cThe Town\u201d features the \u201cBride Wars\u201d of Boston accents. Her performance in \u201cThe Age of Adaline\u201d \u2014 as a woman \u201ccursed\u201d to stay 30 forever \u2014 was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn\u2019t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it\u2019s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something \u2014 beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I\u2019d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don\u2019t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he\u2019s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else\u2019s turn to be \u201cit.\u201d (It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn\u2019t done with that.",
        "Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey? The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!  Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can\u2019t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen \u2013 an engagement, that is! \u201cWord is Mariah took matters into her own hands,\u201d a source tells OK! magazine, \u201cIt was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she\u2019s ready for them to make their relationship official.\u201d  Bryan gave a \u201chearty yes,\u201d as the insider says, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t believe his luck!\u201d It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren\u2019t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. \u201cMariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,\u201d the insider told OK!, \u201cwhere she and Bryan first went public with their romance.\u201d Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d  Mariah\u2019s \u201calso toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,\u201d the source says. \u201cAfter all, she is the queen of Christmas!\u201d Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she\u2019s always wanted, saying \u201cThank God I found you\u201d to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don\u2019t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn\u2019t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She\u2019s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s had tow failed marriages already,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to take any risks here.\u201d Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah\u2019s big day.  Nick and Mariah\u2019s twins \u2013 son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 \u2013 will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah\u2019s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. \u201c[He] will always be a big part of her life,\u201d the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids\u2019 Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah\u2019s ex would be on hand to see her say \u201cI Do\u201d again.",

Justin wore nothing but a pair of black shorts, showcasing his toned torso for his Maniac co-star.  Besides his fine physique, the Leftovers star also showed off his huge back tattoo depicting a pigeon and a rat.  While those two animals juxtaposed might for most people conjure an epic battle to the death in a recent viral video from Brooklyn, Justin recently explained the tat was somehow dedicated to his dogs.

        "It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn\u2019t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin\u2019s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin\u2019s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.  Upon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year\u2019s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.  \u201cHe loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was this time last year that we were told he wasn\u2019t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, \u2018Go to the party. Maybe I won\u2019t be here when you come back, but go.\u2019\u201d  Shapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master\u2019s degree, admits that she can\u2019t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. \u201cYou want to think that it\u2019s like a home movie, but it\u2019s not. That\u2019s not what our relationship was like,\u201d she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. \u201cI\u2019m walking down the street and someone\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!\u2019\u201d  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, and I live in London so it\u2019s good for her to have a distraction.\u201d  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay\u2019s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules\u2013inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan\u2019s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  \u201cThese kids were like, babies, and now they\u2019re running the show,\u201d she said of the crew. \u201cThey lived in my house! And now they\u2019re all corporate. . . . We\u2019re home. It\u2019s cyclical, you know.\u201d  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay\u2019s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan\u2019s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  \u201cShe\u2019s in New York with me,\u201d the matriarch answered. \u201cI keep them close! I\u2019m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!\u201d  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She\u2019s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of \u201cpet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive\u201d rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

Emma Watson appeared uninterested in receiving the top honour at the Elle Style Awards on Monday - and even kept organisers waiting for 90 minutes for her arrival  A source tells MailOnline: 'Emma clearly wasn't interested in the event. She showed up 90 minutes late for the event and refused to walk the red carpet.  'She also insisted on only having her picture taken in a special room with her chosen photographer rather than alongside all the other stars at the bash. She was behaving like a diva.'  After receiving the prize, she was quickly whisked away from the event alone - snubbing the raucous bash at London's 41 Conduit Street.  Emma had stunned in a ivory Dior gown but covered it in a wool coat as she made a speedy exit out of the venue.  Special treatment: The Harry Potter star, 26, has been accused of 'diva behaviour' after she was tardy and also refused to walk the red carpet alongside a host of A-list stars, having her picture taken by her personally chosen photographer in a separate room  Taxi! The actress then spent less than an hour at the event, skipping the raucous bash at London's 41 Conduit Street and heading home  Emma appeared a little sombre as she headed home following her big night, which saw her collect the coveted Woman Of The Year prize.  The Harry Potter favourite missed out on a fun-filled bash, with the night descending into a booze-fuelled danceathon.

        "Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music\u2019s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton \u2014 aka the rocker and the country boy \u2014 have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing \u2026 they\u2019re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his \u201cCountry Music Freaks\u201d trek.      This isn\u2019t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton\u2019s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 \u2014 when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu \u2014 and shared his latest video, \u201cI Lived It\u201d with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch\u2018s \u201cinsider\u201d source, all of Stefani\u2019s social media support is \u201ca desperate attempt to ignore the truth,\u201d and Shelton dumped her due to her \u201cneediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.\u201d  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup \u2014 Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani\u2019s comfort \u2014 as well as Shelton\u2019s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is \u201csharing intimate details\u201d of his life.  Shelton isn\u2019t reciprocating Stefani\u2019s loving social media deluge \u2014 but then again, he\u2019s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",
        "Postby Guest \u00bb Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm  So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",

        "Reverend Swadley \u2013 the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family \u2013 has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad\u2019s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It\u2019s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad\u2019s mum, Jane, who she\u2019d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it\u2019s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley \u2013 hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  \u2018Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad\u2019s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,\u2019 a close friend of the pastor\u2019s told New Idea exclusively.  \u2018Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend\u2019s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  \u2018He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she\u2019s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad\u2019s \u2013 and their \u2013 lives.\u2019  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  \u2018Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,\u2019 the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad\u2019s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  \u2018Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad\u2019s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,\u2019 a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  \u2018He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they\u2019d been brought back together. And how they\u2019ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed \u2013 with Jen\u2019s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.\u2019  It\u2019s the latest chapter in the pair\u2019s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It\u2019s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  \u2018Brad\u2019s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,\u2019 says a source close to Brad. \u2018They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn\u2019t be happier.  \u2018And for Brad, seeing how much his children \u2013 especially Shiloh \u2013 love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  \u2018We\u2019re pretty sure they\u2019ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together.

        "Lady Gaga Alberto E. Rodriguez/ Getty Images  The INSIDER Summary:  Lady Gaga's new documentary will discuss her struggles with chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from \"chronic pain\" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, \"Gaga: Five Foot Two,\" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, \" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,\" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people \"physically, mentally, and socially.\" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.  George Clooney Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla  In addition to Gaga, Morgan Freeman has specifically spoken about dealing with fibromyalgia. In an interview with Esquire, the actor described the pain. \"Up and down the arm,\" he said. \"That's where it gets so bad. Excruciating.\" The actor doesn't let this pain stop him from doing some of the things he enjoys like golfing or walking, but he can't fly pilot jets or drive.  According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the \"pain is a microphone\" and it \"does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,\" Variety reports. Here's hoping \"Gaga: Five Foot Two,\" which will be available on September 22 on Netflix, inspires others suffering to transform the pain.",
        "'Khloe is not a Kardashian': TWO of her father's ex-wives claim he expressed doubts over the paternity of the youngest sister  Father Robert's ex-wives allege he said she wasn't his child  Khloe hits out at wives on Twitter calling them 'disgusting' and 'low'  Mum Kris has admitted to affairs during marriage to late lawyer    More drama erupted for Kim Kardashian and her family, as the ex-wife of her late father today claimed Kim's sister Khloe was not his daughter.    Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said \"Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?\"    'And I said\u2026 \"OK\" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father\u2019s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low\u2026 YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father\u2019s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.

        "Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there\u2019s definitely a lot we don\u2019t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love\u2014Valentine's Day\u2014it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine\u2019s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, \"that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey.\" We guarantee that she will no longer by \"that girl\" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren\u2019t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. \"It was the only way that I could be with them,\" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. \"And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor.\" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that\u2019s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We\u2019ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She\u2019s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we\u2019re pleased to hear that she\u2019s following in her grandmother\u2019s footsteps\u2014both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It\u2019s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we\u2019re happy to hear of Dakota\u2019s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it\u2019s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad\u2019s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn\u2019t at her father\u2019s house, she was at her mom\u2019s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they\u2019re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it\u2019s great to hear of Dakota\u2019s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she\u2019s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn\u2019t just date. That probably explains why she\u2019s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it\u2019s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they\u2019ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems like we have something in common with Dakota Johnson: a loathing of school. Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an \"alien.\" She said she didn\u2019t understand the process of school as a child and felt \"suffocated.\" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn\u2019t really fit in at school so it\u2019s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don\u2019t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we\u2019re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we\u2019re talking full-on panic attacks\u2014the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you\u2019ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another. It happens to all of",
        "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) \u2014 Blake Griffin\u2019s injury-plagued career will now take him to Detroit after being traded to the Pistons on Monday, and the question of a career decline and a link to a certain celebrity family has surfaced.

        "Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It\u2019s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won\u2019t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they\u2019re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  \u201cI am youthful and timeless at every age,\u201d Lopez says every single day\u2014but it\u2019s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. \u201cI tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clich\u00e9d bullshit, but it\u2019s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.\u201d  Lopez continues, \u201cThe affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they\u2019re all here. They\u2019re just part of the house now.\u201d  Before you scoff at Lopez\u2019s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that \u201cwhen pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.\u201d  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what\u2019s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.",

(Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)  A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  \"I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,\" Swift said. \"I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.\"  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  \"I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,\" Swift told the View co-hosts. \"I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.\"  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  \"It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,\" Swift said. \"I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.\"  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.  \"How do you not know how awesome you are?\" Nicolle Wallace asked.  \"I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,\" said Swift.

        "The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert\u2019s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.

Trump called Colbert \u201cno-talent guy.\u201d Colbert\u2019s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints.

Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: \u201cConsistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.\u201d  \u201cThe Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC\u2019s rules.\u201d  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are \u201cindecent.\u201d Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled \u201cobscene\u201d for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that \u201cmust appeal to an average person\u2019s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a \u2018patently offensive\u2019 way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\u201d  Here\u2019s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in an interview with FOX News Channel's 'Sunday Morning Futures' hosted by Maria Bartiromo, said that the Justice Department is \"aggressively\" investigating the leak of a phone call between former national security advisor Gen. Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador.    Background: Washington Post: How Mike Flynn Was Undone By A Phone Call    \"We\u2019re going after this aggressively,\" Sessions said about the leak of the transcript of Flynn's call. \"I am directing it personally... and we\u2019re pursuing it aggressively.\"            Sessions also said that there are currently 27 open investigations regarding leaks of classified information. \"In the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27,\" he noted.      MARIA BARTIROMO: There are felonies apparently that have already taken place. I mean we had on this program just last week, the chairman of the Intel committee Devin Nunez and he said there are felonies that are going, not looked at all they\u2019re going by over and over listen to what he told me just last Sunday.    REP. DEVIN NUNES: The big felony in all of this that nobody talks about from the very beginning was the leak of highly classified information when they leaked the phone call of the Russian ambassador talking to General Mike Flynn right before the inauguration. That was a felony, nothing\u2019s ever been done about it.    BARTIROMO: Is your office investigating this sir?    SESSIONS: That is a violation of the law, to leak classified documents and it is being investigated. I will say this, the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27 we\u2019re going after this aggressively.

        "It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.  Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about \"karma\" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  \"Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It\u2019s karma!!\" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  \"You know, I\u2019ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,\" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  \"I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,\" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, \"I\u2019m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn\u2019t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don\u2019t know why he thinks it's karma.\"  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she \"was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.\"  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The \"Tin Man\" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's \"Livin\u2019 Like Hippies\" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, \"PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you.\"",

        "In the past, Kanye\u2019s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy \u2014 one of the greatest rap albums of all time \u2014 without an \u201cImma let you finish\u201d at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn\u2019t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn\u2019t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month\u2019s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist\u2019s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track \u2018I Thought About Killing You\u2019, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on \u2018No Mistakes\u2019, to keep his fans just interested enough. It\u2019s telling that the one standout track, \u2018Ghost Town\u2019 is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn\u2019t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he\u2019s become blas\u00e9 and doesn\u2019t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway.",

Pretty much every person I know who's got famous is completely nuts. It's just isolation and also the repetitiveness of your interactions with people... It's just weird.\"  But he also explained how he maintained his own sanity. \"I had good agents and stuff and I've had really good friends since the beginning.\"  \"So I think when it gets dangerous for people is when you have no friends and you think, 'Oh, if I get strangers to love me then it will fill that hole.' And then when it doesn't fill the hole, then you go 10 times crazier,'\" he said.  Adding, \"I try to not be seen whatsoever between movies. So hopefully the only thing that exists of you in the public realm is what you agree to put out there.\"  Talking about his mental condition, he admitted that he was really crazy earlier. \"It's always just a control thing. If the control of your life has been taken away from you, that's when you go a little crazy.\"  \"I get so much anxiety in performance and everyone's reaction is to say, 'Just be yourself!' And myself, in general, is the last person I want to be.\" Pattinson told The Telegraph.

Workaholic Kanye West has grand plans to launch a new cosmetics line, but it has wife Kim Kardashian terrified he's stretching himself too thin.\"  The site asserts, \"Coming just a few months after his breakdown that led to an eight-day psychiatric hospitalization, his wife Kim Kardashian is scared about what taking on all this extra work could do to his mental healing.\" A so-called \"source\" is quoted as telling the webloid, \"Kanye's grand plans for business have Kim worried for Kanye's health. Things have been good between Kim and Kanye lately and she admires his ambition, but his latest venture in cosmetics has Kim worried for her husband's health.\"  Yes, that repetitious quote sounds entirely natural.

First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there\u2019s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,\u201d sources tell Straight Shuter. \u201cYou can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.\u201d  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyonc\u00e9 is private. THAT doesn\u2019t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though \u2013 something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don\u2019t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey\u2019s love of music\u2026 Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.  GettyImages/Instagram",
        "Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, \"I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!\" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. \"It's just so special with Bindi,\" he told reporters backstage. \"She's a champion of life.\" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks \"to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!\" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. \"There's not a thing I would change about this season,\" he told Glamour post-show. \"There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible.\" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. \"I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps.\" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. \"Bindi was the whole package,\" praised the red-haired stunner. \"She and Derek had a beautiful partnership.\" Still, \"it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that.\" Echoed Nick: \"It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me.\" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: \"I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot.\" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? \"It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately.\" Added Lindsay: \"I'll be his wing woman on tour!\" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. \"I feel incredible!\" gushed the pro. \"Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!\" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, \"which is our anniversary too.\" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the nerves don't get the best of her. \"I heard you have to brine it, but I don't even know what that means!\" she laughed. \"I'm watching The Chew to learn techniques!\" One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. \"I can't wait,\" admitted Mark Ballas . \"I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat.\" Allison Holker felt the same way: \"I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne.\" Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant. \"She would be great, but you know [the producers] would probably mess with us and give her to Derek!\" Mark joked. So what was B.C.'s take on this idea? \"Yeah, and we'd probably win,\" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother. Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called \"the love of my life\") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. \"It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that. To be able to perform with the love of my life and in front of my brother for life and the beautiful Bindi",

She learned to sing at age 5 and to play the piano at age 7.[3] She made occasional appearances at her father's shows[2] and took vocal lessons from Beyonce's vocal coach, Tim Carter, when she was 14, as well.[3] She also worked in the studio with her brother-in-law (and Good Charlotte lead vocalist) Joel Madden.[4][3] She decided to move away from a music career, however, because of the pressure of living up to her father's stature in the music industry.[5]  Richie spent some time at Oaks Christian School\u2014nicknamed \"Celebrity High\"\u2014before being educated at home for several years while her father was on tour.

        "The actress and her business partner, Saundra Pelletier, sat down with Elaine Welteroth to talk about their new sex-positive digital resource center, Tryst Network, at the 2018 MAKERS Conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Feb. 6.",
        "The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine\u2019s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We\u2019re in Stanley\u2019s on St Andrew\u2019s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It\u2019s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of \u201cLet\u2019s go out, but not to our usual place\u201d. I\u2019ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don\u2019t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley\u2019s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn\u2019t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we\u2019re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There\u2019s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we\u2019re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we\u2019ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley\u2019s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She\u2019s the sommelier here. But don\u2019t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We\u2019re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is \u201camazing\u201d, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a \u20ac16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at \u20ac13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There\u2019s a small farmyard on that \u20ac16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the \u201cbacon and cabbage\u201d, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn\u2019t enough on the plate (there is), we\u2019ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas \u2013 but that\u2019s even better in my book \u2013 and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It\u2019s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There\u2019s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that\u2019s served deliciously chilly. It\u2019s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we\u2019ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that\u2019s what Stanley\u2019s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a",

After playing 150 concerts across 40 countries during the world tour, Bieber cancelled the final 14, saying he was \u201cjust resting, getting some relaxation\u201d. In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.  \u201cI\u2019ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMe taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.\u201d  Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: \u201cLearning and growing hasn\u2019t always been easy but knowing I\u2019m not alone has kept me going.

She is the host of her live-audience, morning show NBC Megyn Kelly Today. She was a news anchor at Fox News from 2004 to 2017, and is currently with NBC News. On January 3, 2017, Kelly announced her departure from Fox News and stated that she would be joining NBC News. On June 4, 2017, she started hosting a Sunday night news magazine program titled Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.[6] From October 2013 to January 2017, during her career at Fox News, Kelly hosted The Kelly File. She previously hosted America Live, and prior to that, co-hosted America's Newsroom with Bill Hemmer. From 2007 to 2012, the two reporters hosted Fox News Channel's New Year's Eve specials, \"All American New Year\". She was included in the 2014 Time list of the 100 most influential people.[7] Early life [ edit ] Kelly was born in Champaign, Illinois,[8] to Edward Kelly, who taught at the State University of New York at Albany, and Linda (n\u00e9e DeMaio), a homemaker.[9] She is of Italian and German descent on her mother's side and Irish descent on her father's.[9] Kelly's father died of a heart attack when she was 15 years old.[10] Kelly was raised Roman Catholic.[11] Kelly attended Tecumseh Elementary School in DeWitt, New York. When she was 9, her family moved to the Albany, New York, suburb[12] of Delmar, where she attended Bethlehem Central High School.[13] She obtained an undergraduate degree in political science from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1992[9] and earned a J.D. from Albany Law School in 1995.[14] Kelly was an associate in the Chicago office of law firm Bickel & Brewer LLP, during which time she co-wrote an article for the American Bar Association's journal, Litigation, called \"The Conflicting Roles of Lawyer as Director\".[15] She later joined Jones Day for nine years, where one of her clients was the credit bureau Experian.[16] Television career [ edit ] Early career [ edit ] In 2003, Kelly moved to Washington, D.C., where she was hired by the ABC affiliate WJLA-TV as a general assignment reporter.[10] While there, she covered significant national and local events, including live coverage of the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. and Chief Justice John G. Roberts; the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist; and the 2004 presidential election.[17] After working as a journalist for WJLA, Kelly then applied for a job at Fox News in 2004.[17] CNN president Jonathan Klein would later regret not hiring Kelly as a reporter at the beginning of her career, as she was \"the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else\".[18] Fox News [ edit ] Kelly contributed legal segments for Special Report with Brit Hume and hosted her own legal segment, Kelly's Court, during Weekend Live. She appeared on a weekly segment on The O'Reilly Factor and occasionally filled in for Greta Van Susteren on On the Record, where most of her reporting focused on legal and political matters. She occasionally contributed as an anchor, but more often as a substitute anchor on weekends.[19] On February 1, 2010, Kelly began hosting her own two-hour afternoon show, America Live, replacing Fox News' previous show The Live Desk.[20][21] She has been a guest-panelist on Fox News' late-night satire program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. In 2010, viewership for America Live increased by 20%, averaging 1,293,000 viewers, and increased by 4% in the 25\u201354 age demographic, averaging 268,000 viewers.[22] In December 2010, Kelly was confirmed to be hosting a New Year's Eve special with Bill Hemmer.[23] Kelly received media attention for her coverage of the results of the 2012 United States presidential election. On November 6, 2012 (the night of the election), Fox News' decision desk projected that Obama would win a second term after part of the results had been released. In response to Karl Rove's opposition to this projection, Kelly walked backstage to the decision desk on camera and spoke with them, and also asked Rove, \"Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?\"[24][25][26][27] Kelly left as host of America Live in the beginning of July 2013 for maternity leave and returned to host a new nightly program The Kelly File on October 7, 2013.[28][29] Over the years, The Kelly File has at different times overtaken the channel's regular number one The O'Reilly Factor in ratings.[30][31] However, The Kelly File has also been overtaken by Hannity.[32] In December 2013, remarks made by Kelly in reaction to a Slate article drew controversy. On The Kelly File, she said, \"For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa,\" adding, \"But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it.\" Kelly also stated that Jesus was a white man later in the segment.[33] Soon after, Jon Stewart,[34] Stephen Colbert,[35] Rachel Maddow,[36] Josh Barro,[37] and others satirized her remarks.[38] Two days later, she made additional on-air statements, characterizing her original comments as \"tongue-in-cheek\",[39][40][41][42][43] and that the skin color of Jesus is \"far from settled\".[44] In June 2015, Kelly interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. She later interviewed two of their daughters, Jill and Jessa. This show's Nielsen national estimates ratings of 3.09 million viewers, above its average 2.11 million, ranked with the 3.2 million for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 coverage and 7.3 million for the Ferguson riots coverage.[45] In the Republican Party presidential debate on August 6, 2015, Kelly asked whether a man of Trump's temperament ought to be elected president.[46] Kelly's moderating generated a range of media and political",
        "(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez\u2019s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper\u2019s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren\u2019t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. \u00a9 Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez\u2019s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt \u201ctied down\u201d in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we\u2019re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a \u201clove triangle\u201d with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn\u2019t caused by the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d singer.

The insider tells OK! \u201cRob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.\u201d  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.  \"He's matured a lot and become this very serious young man,\u201d adds the source. \u201cRob\u2019s dismayed that Charlie [Hunnam] hasn\u2019t given up his pot habit. He doesn\u2019t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.\u201d  But we haven\u2019t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle\u2019s childhood best friend has revealed the real reason her first marriage broke up - and it wasn't a mutual decision.  Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fianc\u00e9e, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  \"The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,\" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,\" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  \"Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There\u2019s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood\u2019s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls\u2019 high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.  (Image: Instagram)  Elsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.

She had one of Princess Diana\u2019s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.\"  She added: \"I wasn\u2019t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries \u2014 films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.\"",

        "Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline? So. Much. Drama. Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we\u2019re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that\u2019s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions. The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive. Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we\u2019ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there\u2019s a lot to dive into. photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn\u2019t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia. Photography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic February 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party Yup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren\u2019t they adorable? photography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty May 2011: Billboard Music Awards Jelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love. photography by steve granitz/contributor/getty November 2011: Jelena is over\u2026 apparently Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it\u2019s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren\u2019t true. photography via pinterest November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin Don\u2019t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there\u2019s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria\u2019s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber. photography via instagram.com/ashilrd January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber They clearly can\u2019t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram\u2026 and of course, promptly deleted it. Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage November 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards The singer took to the stage to perform her single, \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants.\u201d Here\u2019s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they\u2019d split. photography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin December 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours Jelena, what? We\u2019re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means). photography via instagram.com/zedd January 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin Shortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview. photography via instagram.com/selenamylight September 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE Gomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him. photography via instagram.com/selgselgenator November 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show In November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena\u2014thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs?

Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it\u2019s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they\u2019ve since broken up. photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans. Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing \u201cLet Me Love You\u201d So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake\u2019s \u201cLet Me Love You,\u201d which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it\u2019s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez\u2019s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it\u2019s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex\u2019s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena! photography via instagram.com/revivaltour November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?! Photography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ.

        "Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn\u2019t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d boyfriend they needed to break up.  \u201cJamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,\u201d a source told RadarOnline. \u201cKatie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie\u2019s behavior. She knew it wasn\u2019t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.\u201d  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri\u2019s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn\u2019t see her.  \u201cTom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn\u2019t see Suri, he didn\u2019t question it,\u201d an insider told the Star. \u201cBut Tom\u2019s tired of being bossed around by them. He\u2019s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he\u2019s missed out on so much. He\u2019s dying to be a part of her life!\u201d  Holmes isn\u2019t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to \u201cbrainwash\u201d her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what\u2019s best for Suri.  \u201cShe\u2019s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,\u201d an insider told the Star. \u201cSuri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what\u2019s best for her. Tom has assured her he won\u2019t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.\u201d  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes\u2019 publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  \u201cThe Radar story is 100 percent untrue,\u201d Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes\u2019 publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T",

The 41-year-old Oscar winner (and younger brother of Ben Affleck) and 38-year-old actress Summer (the younger sister of Joaquin and the late River Phoenix) split in 2015.

        "Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.  Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a \"lick\" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    \"The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.\"",

(Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules\u2019s \u201cBachelor\u201d fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star\u2019s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. \u201cThis story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,\u201d Mary Jo Brown, Arlington\u2019s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. \u201cSometimes fame isn\u2019t your friend.\u201d Soules, who also appeared in \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and \u201cWorst Chefs in America,\u201d called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver \u2014 later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran \u2014 was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher\u2019s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. \u201cCan I, can I call you back really quick?\u201d Soules asked the dispatcher. \u201cYeah, you can call me back,\u201d she says. \u201cThank you,\u201d Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff\u2019s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules \u201ctook off\u201d in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He \u201cwould not come out,\u201d the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which \u201ctook hours.\u201d Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR \u2014 Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were \u201crunning into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information\u201d but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register. The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules\u2019s publicist earlier this week said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d were with the man\u2019s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora \u2014 population 200 \u2014 lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher\u2019s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. \u201cKenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,\u201d Mosher\u2019s obituary said. \u201cHis family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.\u201d In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.

        "The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (\u00a323,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich \u2014 and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding\u2014 the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (\u00a323.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (\u00a332 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel \u2014 and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place \u2014 is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (\u00a330 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.",
        "  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor \u2014 and two-time People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive cover model \u2014 George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life \u2014 actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, \u201cI don\u2019t see myself ever having kids.\u201d  But it was a long road to get there. \u201cI don\u2019t have that gene that people have to replicate,\u201d he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn\u2019t married with kids, he replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t had aspirations in that way, ever.\u201d And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? \u201cWhat do you do? Should I go, \u2018I got to get me some kids right now!\u2019 and rush out and impregnate someone?\u201d  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: \u201cWell, I\u2019m also not running for president, but I played that role in \u2018Ides of March.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t an actual lawyer when I did \u2018Michael Clayton,\u2019 and I don\u2019t fire people for a living like I did in \u2018Up in the Air.\u2019 \u201d  \u201cI keep saying I\u2019ll never get married again or have children but people just don\u2019t want to believe me,\u201d Clooney told Britain\u2019s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it\u2019s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  \u201cElla, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,\u201d the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. \u201cGeorge is sedated and should recover in a few days.\u201d",

        "Lisa Rinna made her feelings quite clear when she zealously came to her husband Harry Hamlin's defense on Tuesday's episode of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills after Kim Richards accused him of harboring a secret. And now the 63-year-old Mad Men actor is applauding his wife's actions. The LA Law star said that he and Lisa equally defend each other's honor. Scroll down for video Happy couple: Harry Hamlin stood behind his wife Lisa Rinna after her outburst on Tuesday's Real Housewives of Beverly Hills defending his honor. The pair are pictured at an awards dinner in LA in February 'I was actually proud of her. I mean, look -- you are getting your back up against a wall with something like that,' he told US Weekly at the Raising The Bar to End Parkinson\u2019s event in Sherman Oaks, California on Saturday. 'What do you expect you know in the long run? But every time I see it, I go, \"You go girl!'\" Even though he previously had his reservations about his wife coming on the show, Harry now admits Lisa is doing a good job. Make-believe: TMZ has reported that Kim Richards invented the fact that she knows a secret about Harry that Lisa is covering up during last week's episode 'Well, you know, I am [proud] because she\u2019s doing a magnificent job,' he said. 'I think she\u2019s bringing some class to a show that is kind of a reflection of who we are today. 'So in some sense it is art in that respect. I think she\u2019s doing an extraordinary job.' As for the big secret Kim is accusing him of hiding? Harry said he is in the dark just like everyone else. Losing her cool: When Kim, 50, brought up her husband, Lisa, 51, furiously smashed a glass of wine 'There is a hashtag #WhatDidHarryDo? out there so maybe someone will tell me at some point, and I hope it was good,' he joked. On last week's episode, Kim, 50, accused Lisa of harboring a secret about her husband, causing Lisa, 51, to throw and smash a glass full of wine. Fans were left wondering exactly what Kim 'knew' about Harry, 63, but TMZ reports that Kim fabricated the story just to push Lisa\u2019s buttons. In the face: Lisa tossed a glass full of wine into Kim's face According to production sources, the Housewives brought up the issue again during the taping of the reunion episode, and Kim admitted she made it up. The season five reunion episode was filmed on February 20 and will air on a later date. Fans witnessed the feud between Kim and Lisa come to a dramatic head on Tuesday night's episode. In a final flourish after a menacing exchange of words, Lisa furiously smashed a wine glass after throwing the contents in Kim's face. 'I f***ing lost my f***ing marbles,' Lisa admitted later. The astonishing fight came during what should have been a civilized dinner during a trip to Yolanda Foster's hometown of Amsterdam. Drama: The astonishing fight came during what should have been a civilized dinner during a trip to Yolanda Foster's hometown of Amsterdam But the civility did not last long as they started having a serious chat, with Lisa discussing her 'really deep-rooted issues about people dying from alcohol and drug overdoses' after losing her 21-year-old sister when she was just six. Breaking down, Lisa turned to Kim and said: 'I'm sorry if I've ever gotten into any of your business, I never meant to \u2026' 'Well, you have,' Kim snapped, shocking everyone by cutting her short in her emotional moment and bringing up their feud on the jet over there. About to explode: Lisa became outraged after Kim brought up her husband Harry 'I have been sober for three years,' Kim insisted, adding that her one time taking a pill at the poker party was a one off. 'You have gone around to everybody and talked about me,' she said, also pointing to Eileen and saying: 'And you too. She then unexpectedly turned the tables on Lisa, telling her: 'I'm concerned about you, and your situation at home. You wanna bring out my stuff, let's talk about your home life.' Dinner fight: Kim's sister Kyle Richards looked downcast as the fight dragged on As Eileen angrily intervened - telling her 'shame on you' - Kim snapped: 'Shut your f***ing mouth, I've had enough of you you beast.' As Yolanda tried to calm everyone down, she mentioned about how Lisa was understanding because she has admitted that her husband Harry has only been sober for three years. 'Let's talk about the husband,' Kim said spitefully. 'Let's not talk about what you don't want out.' Too much drama: Kyle, 46, became upset after watching sister Kim's outburst and its aftermath That was when Lisa exploded, initially trying to grab Kim's face as she snapped: 'Let me tell you something - don't touch my husband, ever.' 'If you don't want it out for everybody to know, you better watch what you talk about me, or everybody will know,' Kim replied. 'Everybody will know.' Lisa then stood up, threw the contents of her glass at Kim and then angrily smashed it on the table's edge, screaming as Yolanda held her back: 'You never go near my husband! Don't you f***ing understand that? You never go after my f***ing husband!' Reflecting on her behaviour: 'I f***ing lost my f***ing marbles,' Lisa admitted later Later, she asked: 'What the f*** does Kim Richards know - what does she know about Harry? What did he do? She doesn't even know my husband.' Kim's hatred did not extend just to Lisa and Eileen, 55, - she also attacked her sister Kyle, snidely saying 'go after your new friend' as Kyle, 46, prepared to leave in tears. 'You want me to defend you but your behavior is indefensible!' she sobbed. Making up: Kim surprised Lisa the next morning by coming to her room to talk things",

        "Ellen DeGeneres has all the feels! On Thursday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the daytime talk show host continues to celebrate her 60th birthday by having wife Portia de Rossi on the program. Seated next to Ellen, the 45-year-old actress proceeds to bring her wife of nine years to tears upon presenting her with the \"best\" gift. \"It's your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,\" Portia explains. \"Not just now, but what you've always cared about. What you were influenced by and what has made you the amazing person that you are today. So, I combined that and questions when we first met like, 'Who's your idol? And what would you do if you weren't a talk show host?'\" She continues, \"So, I combined that with the fact that literally guys, for, like, the last two years, Ellen has said to me, 'I feel like I'm not doing enough.' Every day, almost. So, I put all that together and I got you this gift. So, let's see it -- happy birthday!\" Portia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. \"So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,\" she reveals. \"Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!\" Portia didn't stop there! \"I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,\" she shares. \"So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do.\" Blown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, \"It\u2019s the best gift. I\u2019ve always said -- and when we got married, Portia\u2019s line was, 'It\u2019s good to be loved; it\u2019s profound to be understood' -- and, she understands me because that is the best gift that anybody could have given me. So, I love you.\" See photos of the couple together: 44 PHOTOS Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi See Gallery Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi during VH1 Big in '04 - Backstage and Audience at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, United States. ***Exclusive*** (Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, Inc) Portia de Rossi and Ellen DeGeneres during HBO Golden Globe Awards Party - Inside at Beverly Hills Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, United States.

        "More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor\u2019s shocking dismissal.  \u201cThe whole thing has been very painful for me,\u201d Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. \u201cThe accounts I\u2019ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it\u2019s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  \u201cI had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It\u2019s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.\u201d  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer \u201cpinches me on the ass a lot.\u201d A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer\u2019s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC\u2019s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a \u201cdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d with reason to believe \u201cthis may not have been an isolated incident.\u201d Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  \u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d he said, in part. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\u201d  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer\u2019s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I\u2019m ready to. Thanks for your interest.\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time\u2019s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men \u2014 including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp \u2014 have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time\u2019s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time\u2019s Up was a major focus at this year\u2019s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  \u201cI think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,\u201d Couric tells PEOPLE about Time\u2019s Up. \u201cClearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.\u201d  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  \u201cOne of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,\u201d she says. \u201cI just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ",
        "Robert Pattinson is raising some questions in the romance department.  The actor, 31, made headlines late last month after he said he's only \"kind of\" engaged to FKA twigs during an interview with Howard Stern. Fast forward to this weekend when he was spotted getting cozy with good pal Katy Perry during a dinner outing Saturday night, causing lots of fans to question what's really going on.  Well, E! News has learned things might be heating up between Pattinson and Perry as he's already allegedly cooled off from FKA twigs, who he started dating in 2014 and proposed to the following year.  \"He is technically still with FKA twigs, but it doesn't seem like it will last,\" one source told us. \"They were serious at one point, but not anymore. The whole thing with Rob saying they are 'kind of engaged' speaks for itself. The relationship has been fizzling out.\"",

The first appears to show a woman and Kevin in a club getting cozy. The tape then cuts to a bed, where you don't see the people in the bed ... but hear creaking and what could be people having sex. You never see Kevin in the 2nd clip. The 3rd clip shows 2 people milling around a room, one of them looks vaguely like Kevin.

Kevin Hart is getting out in front of a messy situation by apologizing publicly to his wife and kids, and TMZ has learned it's all over a video that looks like he's cheating.  Kevin profusely apologized to his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, and his kids on Instagram Saturday ... saying he recently made some mistakes he deeply regrets.  Sources tell TMZ a woman has allegedly demanded money from Kevin after shooting a video with him in which Kevin and the woman are engaged in \"sexually suggestive\" conduct. We are told it is NOT a sex tape, but looks like it is a prelude to sex. We're told that at a point in the tape when the action is the heaviest, you cannot actually see Kevin.  A rep for Kevin tells us ... \"Someone tried to set Kevin up in a failed extortion attempt. As law enforcement is involved, we cannot comment further as it could affect the investigation.\"",
        "\u201cA Star Is Born\u201d is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It\u2019s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own \u2014 rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It\u2019s set in the present day, but in spirit it\u2019s a sophisticated retro \u201970s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie\u2019s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol\u2019-boy redneck rock \u2018n\u2019 roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he\u2019s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes \u2014 that\u2019s the soapy tragic \u201cStar Is Born\u201d concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that\u2019s shorn of the usual \u201cbeats.\u201d The new \u201cStar Is Born\u201d is a total emotional knockout, but it\u2019s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it\u2019s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn\u2019t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like \u201cVictim of Love\u201d-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That\u2019s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll movie since \u201cAlmost Famous.\u201d And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look \u2014 the beard and rancher\u2019s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle \u2014 mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock \u2018n\u2019 roll strutted its \u201cauthenticity,\u201d but now that he\u2019s out of date, Jackson\u2019s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It\u2019s a part he\u2019s playing, an image he\u2019s working \u2014 and secretly struggling \u2014 to keep alive. He\u2019s got a signature ballad that goes \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to let the old ways die,\u201d and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn\u2019t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he\u2019s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It\u2019s what he believes in more than the show he\u2019s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to \u201cplay drunk,\u201d but Cooper doesn\u2019t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it\u2019s powerful). He brings off something I\u2019ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl \u2014 a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it\u2019s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It\u2019s not his scene, but he doesn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he\u2019s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage. She is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she\u2019s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We\u2019ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of \u201cLa Vie en Rose\u201d that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, \u201cOf course! How Gaga-netic!\u201d Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally\u2019s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink. But when she emerges from the dressing room",
        "Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn\u2019t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn\u2019t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she\u2019s doing just fine. She\u2019s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an \u201cindustry creative,\u201d whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there\u2019s no reason to believe we\u2019ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she\u2019s in love or having babies.  \u201cFor the record, I am not pregnant,\u201d she wrote then. \u201cWhat I am is fed up.

        "Emily Olivia Leah Blunt (born 23 February 1983)[3] is a British-American actress.[4] She is the recipient of several accolades, including one Golden Globe Award and has been nominated for two competitive British Academy Film Awards. Educated in the performing arts at the Hurtwood House in Dorking, Blunt made her acting debut in a 2001 stage production of The Royal Family. She went on to appear in the television film Boudica and portrayed the ill-fated queen consort Catherine Howard in the miniseries Henry VIII (both 2003), following which she made her feature film debut in the 2004 drama My Summer of Love. Blunt's breakthrough came in 2006 when she starred in the television film Gideon's Daughter and the highly successful American comedy film The Devil Wears Prada. The former won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and the latter earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Blunt's profile continued to expand as she took on leading roles in the period film The Young Victoria (2009), the romantic comedy Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011), the science fiction films The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Looper (2012), and Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and the musical fantasy Into the Woods (2014). She was praised for playing a principled FBI agent in the crime film Sicario (2015) and an alcoholic woman in the thriller The Girl on the Train (2016); for the latter she received nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. In 2018, Blunt starred alongside her husband, John Krasinski, in the acclaimed horror film A Quiet Place, and will next star as Mary Poppins in the musical fantasy film Mary Poppins Returns. Early life [ edit ] Blunt was born in Wandsworth, London.[5][6] She is the second of four children[7] born to Joanna, a former actress and teacher,[8][9] and barrister Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, QC.[10][11][12] Her siblings are Felicity, Sebastian, and Susannah.[10][13] Her grandfather was Major-General Peter Blunt, and one of her paternal uncles is Crispin Blunt,[14] Conservative Member of Parliament for Reigate. From the age of seven to 14, Blunt struggled with stuttering.[15] She credits a school teacher for helping her overcome the stutter through acting.[16] She went on to sit on the board of directors for the American Institute for Stuttering.[17] Blunt attended Ibstock Place School in Roehampton, southwest London and, at the age of 16, went to Hurtwood House in Dorking, Surrey, a private sixth-form college known for its performing arts programme. There, she was discovered and signed by an agent.[18][not in citation given] Career [ edit ] 2001\u20132004: Career beginnings [ edit ] In November 2001, Blunt made her professional debut opposite Dame Judi Dench in Sir Peter Hall's production of the play The Royal Family, in which she played the role of the granddaughter Gwen to Dench's Fanny Cavendish. Critic Tom Keatinge hailed the production, writing that \"Peter Hall's direction and Anthony Ward's tremendous set combine with all this to make The Royal Family a terrific night's entertainment\", and that \"it provides a vehicle for acting of the finest quality, with strong performances from the whole ensemble\".[19] For her performance, Blunt was named \"Best Newcomer\" by the Evening Standard. She went on to perform as Eugenie in Nicholas Wright's Vincent in Brixton at the National Theatre, and as Juliet in Indhu Rubasingham's production of Romeo and Juliet at Chichester Festival Theatre, both in 2002.[18] In 2003, Blunt made her screen debut in the British television drama Boudica, about the life of the ancient Celtic warrior-queen who fought the Romans. That same year, she was praised for her performance as the 16th-century queen Catherine Howard in the two-part British television drama Henry VIII.[18] In 2004, Blunt received considerable attention for her performance as Tamsin in the independent British drama My Summer of Love, a love story revolving around two young women from different social and economic backgrounds in the English countryside.[18] Director Pawel Pawlikowski gave high praise to Blunt and co-star Natalie Press, stating in an interview that \"Both Natalie and Emily were extremely different and very original, which is a rare thing nowadays. They avoid the obvious, and are capable of playing complex and conflicting attitudes. Above all, they had energy, which is key for a movie.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film, calling it a \"gem\" lost in the \"hype\" of Hollywood blockbusters, and noted that \"Both Natalie Press and Emily Blunt [...] are superlative. They nail their cinematic alter-egos effortlessly, using verbal and non-verbal cues to tap into their emotions. They understand their characters and use their talents to bring them to life.\"[20] She shared the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer with Press.[21] 2005\u20132010: The Devil Wears Prada and breakthrough [ edit ] Blunt starred opposite Bill Nighy and Miranda Richardson in the British television drama Gideon's Daughter,[18] based on an original screenplay written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, where she played the troubled only child of New Labour spin doctor Gideon Warner, played by Nighy. The film premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival in 2005, and debuted on British television in February 2006. Praised for its \"sterling performances,\"[22] Blunt won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her performance.[23] She then featured opposite Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway in the comedy The Devil Wears Prada, set in the fashion world in New York City. Blunt played Emily, the senior assistant of Runway magazine editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly, played by Streep. Blunt and Hathaway were required to maintain a strict diet regimen for their roles, so much so that Hathaway later revealed that it made them cry.[24] The film was a commercial and critical success, grossing $326,551,094.[25] Though Streep garnered most of the attention for her role, Blunt's performance was equally praised, with Clifford Pugh of The Houston Chronicle asserting that",
        "After years of overexposure thanks to his star-making turn in Twilight, Robert Pattinson values his privacy.  The actor appears on the September cover of GQ where he explained why he chooses to stay very quiet when it comes to his private life.  \u201cI always think the risk reward is very much weighted in the wrong direction,\u201d Pattinson, 31, said of opening up in interviews. \u201cIf I could stay silent, I would.\u201d  Pattinson has been dating singer F.K.A. Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were \u201ckind of\u201d engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor \u2014 who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs \u2014 responded with a noncommittal \u201ceh.\u201d  Daniel Jackson/GQ  Pattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago \u2013 and his therapist commented that he was good at \u201ctalking without saying anything.\u201d He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don\u2019t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.  RELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone & More  \u201cI want to be misunderstood,\u201d he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. \u201cPeople are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they\u2019re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.\u201d  FROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on \u2018This Is Us\u2019, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity  The actor also revealed the great lengths he\u2019d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers \u2013 and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.  \u201cThere are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just involves effort, and most people can\u2019t be bothered to put the effort in.\u201d  Good Time hits theaters August 11.",
        "Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We\u2019ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they\u2019re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that \u201cRihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,\u201d an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn\u2019t doing too well after the split. \u201cOf course Rihanna broke his heart. That\u2019s what she does \u2014 break men\u2019s hearts.\u201d Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO\u2019s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They\u2019ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The \u201cWork\u201d singer\u2019s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said \u201cWaiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don\u2019t like too many compliments; I don\u2019t like to be put on blast.\u201d As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven\u2019t spoken and that \u201cWe don\u2019t have a friendship now, but we\u2019re not enemies either. It is what it is.\u201d However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. \u201cI used to feel guilty about taking personal time,\u201d she revealed, \u201cbut I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,\u201d she said about her romance with Hassan.",
        "MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  Stay informed on the latest rare disease news and developments by signing up for our newsletter  In this week\u2019s Hollywood gossip, it was revealed that Brad Pitt does not have a rare disease that is \u2018eating him away.\u2019Whew.However, the actor is no stranger to the rare disease community. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease \u2013 prosopagnosia \u2014 also known as face blindness. According to the article, \"Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls \"a real conversation,\" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.\"It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.",
        "Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, \u201cJen To Justin: I\u2019ll Raise Our Baby Alone!\u201d followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston\u2019s marriage is \u201con the rocks,\u201d and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?\u2026\u2764\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  \u201cPrivately, she has told friends that she\u2019s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she\u2019s vowed to raise the baby alone,\u201d tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn\u2019t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn\u2019t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one\u2019s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people\u2019s choices.

        "Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled \"Spring Breaks: Part 1\", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in \"200 Cigarettes\", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in \"Gossip\" and \"Dr T and the Women\" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.",
        "Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise\u2019s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he\u2019s still struggling to salvage what\u2019s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer\u2019s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, \u201cRachel and Daniel haven\u2019t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.\u201d The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in \u2018554 days\u2019.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple\u2019s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York\u2019s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, \u201cThe whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don\u2019t buy it for a minute.\u201d  When you consider Daniel Craig\u2019s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, \u201cBeing on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don\u2019t trust myself. I need that balance.\u201d If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now \u2013 all of a sudden \u2013 he\u2019s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he\u2019s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories \u2013 and how they\u2019ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat \u2013 one wouldn\u2019t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel\u2019s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he\u2019s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures",
        "Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.  People are always saying unflattering things about you.  Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.  Is it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  If you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.  You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across \"seemingly\" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  And so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.  We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.  On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.  Something Kardashian has surely done.",

        "Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, \u201cThe actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.\u201d  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise\u2019s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  \u201cTom\u2019s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it\u2019s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It\u2019s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.\u201d  It\u2019s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that\u2019s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris.

Though we as a public have received no evidence of how Kendall reacted to the onslaught of criticism (she has deleted all evidence of it on her social media and has never made a statement), Kim explains that Kendall would never let herself be shown on camera crying.  She told the magazine:  We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.' She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.

        "First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with \u201cheavy sedatives\u201d smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump\u2019s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a \u201cslower, damaged version\u201d.  \u201cBy 8pm he is slurring,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the man I know.\u201d  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  \u201cDonald\u2019s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,\u201d Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is \u201ca high level operation\u201d and \u201cnot the work of a solitary loon.\u201d  Melania is popular in the White House\u2014as she is with the rest of the country\u2014and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan\u2019s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a \u201cbrain damaged\u201d state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump\u2019s food choices say a lot about the man. The president\u2019s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn\u2019t trust those around him \u2013 and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president\u2019s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence\u2019s meal was not unusual\u2014he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.",

She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'\u2026 She did something so horrible. I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational \u2014 you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it.\" While Swift mentioned that the feud wasn't about a boy, she and Perry both famously dated John Mayer, and Rolling Stone notes that when \"pressed,\" Swift said there was a personal aspect to the drama, \"but I don't think there would be any personal problem if she weren't competitive.\" Both chart-topping women were also on tour beginning in February 2011, with Perry wrapping in January 2012 and Swift in March 2012. PHOTOS: Katy Perry's Craziest Style Moments For her part, Swift chose not to offer further clues as to the inspiration for \"Bad Blood.\" Other artists whose names have been included in the talk include Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato. In an online watercooler poll at Us Weekly, 70 percent of more than 8,500 readers who voted guessed the song was about Cyrus. Bachelor in Paradise's Michelle and Cody Want to Wed -- Maybe on TV! Michelle Money and Cody Sattler may have left paradise, but they're still very much in the honeymoon period of their relationship. The reality stars, who fell in love as contestants on ABC's Bachelor spin-off Bachelor in Paradise, are even more smitten now than they were when they filmed the finale back in June. \"It's been so easy, and it's only gotten better since the show ended,\" personal trainer Sattler tells Us Weekly exclusively. \"It's going in the right direction, I can tell you that!\" Money had looked for love on two previous Bachelor Nation shows \u2014 Brad Womack's second season of The Bachelor in 2011, and season two of Bachelor Pad later that same year \u2014 but it took going to paradise to find her perfect match. (Sattler was a contestant on Andi Dorfman's season of The Bachelorette in 2014.)

I've had some amazing experiences and met incredible people, but I've never met anyone as amazing as Cody. I never thought someone like him existed. It's been such a beautiful surprise.\" The lovebirds currently live in different states, but they talk and text \"all day, every day,\" and they also make it a point to see each other in person every other weekend, Money says, adding that they just returned from a vacation with her family. \"It was amazing. My family adores him.\" That includes her 9-year-old daughter, Brielle. \"She loves Cody,\" Money gushes. \"We laugh nonstop. Cody is a big jungle gym for her \u2014 she climbs all over him. They're like two little kids.\" She adds of her beau: \"He has such a positive, genuine,",
        "The rumor mill is churning out some fake news about Barbados' own Rihanna.  In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: \u2018If Jesus Hasn\u2019t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan\u2019, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  \"You have to hustle. I\u2019m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y\u2019all the biggest one straight off...  \"If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.\"  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so \"believe in your dreams\", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  \"I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it\u2019s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.\u201d  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.

        "Kim Kardashian is allegedly \u201cphasing out\u201d mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That\u2019s according to a new report by Radar Online, who\u2019s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner \u201cused her\u201d to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now \u201cseems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,\u201d which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  \u201c[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,\u201d the source said of Jenner\u2019s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been \u201cusing\u201d her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian\u2019s career going forward.  \u201cKim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,\u201d the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that \u201cpart of this process includes phasing out [Kris\u2019s] management.\u201d  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner\u2019s \u201cmoney making machine\u201d after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she\u2019s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her \u201cmomager,\u201d had been controlling her life and career.  \u201cKim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,\u201d an insider told the site of Kardashian\u2019s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to \u201cphase out\u201d Kris from her career.  \u201cKim is just starting to think that maybe Kris\u2019s intentions were not pure all along,\u201d continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris\u2019s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  \u201c[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris\u2019s help,\u201d a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.  What do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to \u201cphase out\u201d her mother\u2019s management?

        "Caitlyn Jenner told Diane Sawyer that she had undergone \"the final surgery\" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night's \"20/20\" special.  The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book \"The Secrets of My Life,\" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 \"surgery was a success.\"  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had \"no regrets, none whatsoever.\"  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, \"I\u2019m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.\"  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been \"happy, peaceful\u2026all of that confusion has left me\u2026.I did the right thing\" -- and doesn't miss \"Bruce\" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how\u2014when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: \"When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.\"  As many know from her former reality show, \"I Am Cait,\" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, \"Yes, I did vote for Trump.\"  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, \"He wanted me to come play golf with him.\"  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  \"It was extremely disappointing\u2026you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,\" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is \"what's between your ears.\"  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  \"Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,\" commented the former \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has \"never been on a date\" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  \"I want to fight this fight,\" she vowed.

        "Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan\u2019s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league\u2019s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa\u2019s \u201cLive! With Kelly\u201d co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d; it took more than a year for \u201cLive\u201d to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan\u2019s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC\u2019s morning show \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, \u201c$100,000 Pyramid,\u201d a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on \u201cFox NFL Sunday\u201d each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.

        "Caitlyn Jenner is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot, DailyMail.com can disclose.  Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, \u2018The Secrets of My Life\u2019. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be \u2018wholly supportive\u2019 of Jenner\u2019s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is \u2018their worst nightmare\u2019.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, \u2018The Secrets of My Life\u2019. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be \u2018wholly supportive\u2019 of Jenner\u2019s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is \u2018their worst nightmare\u2019  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old\u2019s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  \u2018Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that\u2019s unacceptable, it\u2019s taking things too far,' the source said.  \u2018They\u2019re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner\u2019s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  \u2018She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,\u2019 said the source. \u2018But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making \u2018I am Cait\u2019 shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated [\u2026] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  \u2018I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner\u2019s \u2018unpredictable\u2019 behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: \u2018[The book] is definitely something that she\u2019s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  \u2018But the family were like, it\u2019s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  \u2018They were worried because she\u2019s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.\u2019  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J.

Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson\u2019s defense team during his 1",
        "Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of \u201cuncomfortable questions\u201d by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  \u201cThe petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,\u201d Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  \u201cThere is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,\u201d Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna \u201cis motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.\u201d  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna\u2019s adoptions in Malawi. \u201cIn determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,\u201d the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi \u201cto check on the children\u2019s hospital in Blantyre.\u201d) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna\u2019s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins\u2019 mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. \u201cI can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,\u201d she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. \u201cI am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!\u201d  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

We\u2019ve learned EXCLUSIVELY that there\u2019s one reason that Angelina would welcome Brad back with open arms.  Hope may not be lost after all for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt\u2018s marriage. While they are firmly split and on their way to an official divorce, a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Angelina changing her mind could still be a possibility! She and Brad, and their family, have been through so much after breaking up nearly one year ago. But there\u2019s still love there, and it\u2019s up to Brad to make her feel it again!  \u201cAngelina definitely has regrets about splitting from Brad and about the end of their marriage. At the time of the breakup things were really bad between them \u2014 they had been fighting a lot \u2014 and she felt that Brad had checked out of their relationship,\u201d a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cObviously, there was a lot of drama surrounding the split, and bad feelings on both sides. Angelina misses Brad a lot more than she ever thought she would. She feels really lonely without him. Brad was Angelina\u2019s best friend, as well as her husband. They talked about everything and totally had each other\u2019s back. Angelina is a really stubborn person, and there\u2019s no way she would admit to having made a mistake, but if Brad came crawling back to her and begged for another chance, she would willingly drop the divorce.\u201d  Could it happen? Could we really see the rise and fall, and rise of Brangelina again in our lifetime? Angelina\u2019s already made it clear that she\u2019s pleased with the progress Brad\u2019s made in his sobriety. But Brad allegedly isn\u2019t too thrilled with the prospect of making up, according to a report from Life & Style. And on their wedding anniversary, August 23, they gave each other the silent treatment, we learned EXCLUSIVELY. They didn\u2019t want to ruminate on the sad day.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina\u2019s rep for comment.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina and Brad could make it work? Let us know!",
        "Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fianc\u00e9 Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.  \u201cIt was just perfect,\u201d Bischoff tells PEOPLE. \u201cI was completely shocked. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn\u2019t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!\u201d  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (\u201cLadies pick \u2014 finally it was my choice,\u201d jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  \u201cOn our first date, we just clicked,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was easy and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d  Still, Bischoff admits it was \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. \u201cI was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.\u201d  Bischoff hasn\u2019t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. \u201cI hope that he meets someone, if he hasn\u2019t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.\u201d  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she\u2019s moved on from her own reality show past. \u201cThat journey was a big part of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cBut since I\u2019ve met Ricky, I really haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn\u2019t let my past close off my heart. Everything works out for a reason.\u201d",

        "Three years after announcing their separation and more than a year after filing for divorce, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are still legally married \u2014 and they may be that way for a while if they don\u2019t act fast.  LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  \u201cIf you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,\u201d the document states.  It\u2019s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  \u201cWe are definitely a modern family. We\u2019re doing really well,\u201d Garner said previously. \u201cIt has to be [children first]. You have no choice. It has to be.\u201d  Reps for Garner and Affleck did not immediately return requests for comment.  Related Video 1:00 The ugliest celebrity divorces ever",
        "They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.) It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan\u2019s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud. It somehow looked charming and just right. The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring. There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary m\u00e9lange including the archbishop of Canterbury and \u2014 in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places \u2014 the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry\u2019s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry\u2019s life since his mother\u2019s death had finally lifted. It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: \u201cArise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity. Photo Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle\u2019s dress. It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. It was Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped. This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle\u2019s own independence. At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job). The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations. Video And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller\u2019s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue. And the After-Party Dress The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman\u2019s reaction here. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails). Photo Unlike a lot of weddings \u2014 and certainly unlike Kate and William\u2019s wedding, just seven years ago \u2014 the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It\u2019s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.) Kate and William\u2019s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good. But this looked totally fun for the guests \u2014 even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards \u2014 because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters. Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years. Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it\u2019s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.) This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration. Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my! Photo One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry\u2019s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George\u2019s Chapel. It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor.

They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing. There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Diana\u2019s brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sister\u2019s death. It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train). David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.",

        "$25 million later, Angelina Jolie has a new home in Los Angeles! Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she\u2019s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate \u2014 check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles\u2026and it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s historic mansion, and now, she\u2019s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil\u2019s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There\u2019s tons of space for the six kids, too \u2014 the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she\u2019s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie\u2019s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she\u2019s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane \u2014 check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina\u2019s new house? Do you think she\u2019s prepping for a wedding?",

        "Getty  According to the publication bombshell report, both duchesses, 36, are preparing to raise the royal cousins as part of 'one big, happy family.'  An insider said, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.  For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  In Touch  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.

And you know what? They don\u2019t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can\u2019t even see what is right in front of their eyes.\u201d  \u201cFirst they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  \u201cThen they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!\u201c  \u201cAnd now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,\u201d Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey\u2019s house.  \u201cWhen they get hit with the \u2018Big One\u2018, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, \u201cthen we will know that the End Times have truly begun.\u201d  \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood.

At last year\u2019s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.",

She tweeted: \"RT if I should star in the new BATGIRL movie and everyone tell @joss [sic]\"  Lohan has upped her efforts to try and get an audition to be Batgirl and has been messaging Ben Affleck - who plays Batman in the DC Extended Universe - to ask him to help her get the part of the all-action redhead.  A source told Australia's NW Magazine: \"She's been blowing up [Affleck's] phone.

If Lohan is going to be Batgirl then she is going to have to beat Emma Stone to the role, as she is currently believed to be the favourite for the Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Films project.  However, Whedon, 53, previously revealed he would like to cast an unknown actress as his leading lady.  Speaking about his casting process, he said: \"I doubt it will be a name. This is somewhere where you go and find Batgirl and then you cast her. I'm not against movie stars, they're great, but you need somebody who's going to be just right.\"  Lohan currently splits her time between America and Dubai, and she has said that living out in the United Arab Emirates has allowed her to have more of a private life.  The 'Mean Girls' star said: \"I didn't really know how to have a private life, because I was so young. I really enjoy my serenity in Dubai ... you can go out and have fun, but it's a different kind of fun that you have.\"",
        "Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.  Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's \"Dreamgirls,\" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  \"My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!\" she wrote.  \"Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,\" she added. \"You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.\"  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  \"I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,\" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in \"The Color Purple,\" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her \"Uncle Tom\" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  \"It just really made my heart drop to my feet,\" Holliday said. \"How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.\"  Holliday was to perform at the \"Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.",

Despite rumors of a split or the couple taking a break, a source tells ET that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are \"still together.\"    While they often spend time apart, the source explains that distance between them is generally for \"various reasons,\" saying, \"It's not because they are broken up or taking a break.\"    In fact, both Gomez and Bieber were seen leaving church together in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, albeit in separate vehicles.  Pap Nation/Splash News  Pap Nation/Splash News  Though they do not seem to be calling it quits, the source admits, \"that doesn't mean things are perfect between them. They have issues just like any other couple.\"  The pair started dating in 2010 and had been on and off until 2015. They reconnected late last year and have kept their relationship very private, as Selena continues to put her health issues and personal needs first. The 25-year-old \"Wolves\" singer suffers from lupus and underwent a kidney transplant last year.  \"She's still working hard, looking after her health, and doing what's good for her,\" the source notes. \"Justin isn't walking all over her.\"  ET previously reported that Gomez\u2019s friends and family, particularly her mother, Mandy Teefey, struggled with the couple\u2019s reunion, given the pair\u2019s ups and downs in the past. According to the source, that conflict continues to play a part in her relationship with Bieber.  \"It's not easy for Selena to be stuck in the middle,\u201d the source says. \"Her family not liking him is the biggest issue -- but if they can get through that or if her family changes their tune, things will be a lot smoother.\"  Despite the drama, the singer publicly acknowledged her rekindled romance with Bieber for the first time last week on his 24th birthday. \"March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom,\" Gomez wrote alongside a picture of her laughing with a Polaroid of Bieber on her forehead.  See more on the pair\u2019s reconciliation in the video below.

        "Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin recently got engaged after a month of dating (Summer 2018 strikes again!), and now the internet is speculating about WHY they're rushing into marriage.  The obvious answer is that Justin and Hailey are in love and want to spend forever together, but there's also a rumor lurking in some corners of the internet (read: Twitter) claiming that Hailey's pregnant. Which, to be clear, is definitely not anyone's business, and is also pretty sexist!

You stated that you guys are family, so everybody was thinking she might be pregnant.\"  Justin's response? To stop in his tracks and call this dude out, saying \"What\u2019s your deal, bro? You just seem too like, you just seem too normal to be doing this job... I just don\u2019t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I\u2019m saying?\" He also said \"No, you know what you\u2019re doing\" when the pap tried to defend himself, and eventually asked for the camera to be turned off.  Honestly, Justin handled himself pretty well in the face of a highly inappropriate and boundary-crossing question. Agree?",

National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor \"has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!\"  The publication claims that there's a \"hush-hush government investigation\" surrounding the \"Money Monster\" actor and \"the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it.\" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his \"generous nature,\" had a \"desire to spread the wealth.\" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, \"Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.\"  \"There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,\" the insider continued, before adding, \"But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag.\" The insider asserts, \"This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!\"  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any \"federal attention.\" A representative for the \"Ocean's Eleven\" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer \"is fabricated.\"",
        "Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye \u201cplan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.\"  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the \"Netflix and Chill Act?\" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says \"Kim is doing okay despite reports.\"  \"She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,\" the source continued. \"She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.\"  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles .",

        "The current editor in chief of Vogue magazine, Anna Wintour, has a net worth of $35 million. In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.",

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star\u2019s failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  \u201cReese is furious that Nicole hasn\u2019t done more to support Big Little Lies. All she talked about in the interviews was Lion. Had Reese known that Nicole would put the show so far on the back-burner, she would have cast some random person in the show,\u201d Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.  Red carpet roundup: Golden girls at Oscars 2017  In Australia, Big Little Lies\u2018 debut outranked any HBO series broadcast on Foxtel in a launch week, more than doubling the audience that tuned in to see Game of Thrones\u2018 first-ever episode.  But New Idea suggests that it\u2019s the underwhelming reception in her own home country that has left Reese disappointed. Reese is one of the executive producers for the show after all.  According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. \u201cYou could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,\u201d claimed the source.

As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions. Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income.

        "If you see people queueing around the block by Harry Styles's house today, it might be because the One Direction singer is in need of a shoulder to cry on following reports girlfriend Tess Ward ended their relationship.  We'll join the back of that queue, shall we?  According to The Sun, blogger and chef Tess called time on things with Harry earlier this week, citing still having feelings for her ex as the main reason.

Tess [also] realised she still had feelings for her ex after splitting from him to date Harry and has apologised to him for her romance with the singer.  \"It will take a while for Tess to build back his trust but they have been getting on as normal. She was in London this week and met her ex straight away \u2014 they\u2019ve been inseparable since.\"  The poor little lamb.

        "By Bang  Jennifer Aniston is \"casually dating\" again following her split from husband Justin Theroux.  The 'Horrible Bosses' star is moving on from husband Justin Theroux and is enjoying \"seeing where things go\".  A source told Entertainment Tonight: \"Jennifer really relied on her friends to get her through the tough times. During that time, she was able to heal and be comfortable with dating again. Jennifer has never felt she needed a man, but she loves love. Jennifer is casually dating, but right now nothing serious. She is just having fun, seeing where things go. She won't fall in love anytime soon. All her friends are around her. That is the best supportive group.\"  Neither the 'Leftovers' actor nor the former 'Friends' actress have spoken about the split since they released a joint statement on the end of their two-and-a-half-year marriage following increased speculation about the state of their marriage.  They said at the time: \"In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.

        "Lucky number 4? Angelina Jolie could be getting married again, according to a shocking new report! She has allegedly been dating a mystery man for months now, and hasn\u2019t told Brad a thing!  She\u2019s still technically married to Brad Pitt, 52, but Angelina Jolie, 41, allegedly has her heart set on a new marriage. Barely a year after filing for divorce from her husband, Angelina is reportedly planning her fourth wedding to a wealthy, 40-something businessman and philanthropist, according to InTouch Weekly! Angelina and her handsome British guy reportedly started dating in early 2017, and has been keeping the whole relationship \u201cvery hush-hush.\u201d That means that Brad has no idea she\u2019s dating, let alone engaged or getting married. Uh oh!  \u201cAngelina could tell Brad what\u2019s going on but she\u2019s choosing not to,\u201d a source told InTouch. She reportedly hopes he \u201cwill be taken by complete surprise. If it makes Brad unhappy when he finds out, she\u2019s fine with that.\u201d She actually hasn\u2019t even told her six kids about the alleged wedding for fear that they\u2019ll spill the beans to their dad. Crafty!  As for the wedding itself, Angelina\u2019s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, \u201cher second home,\u201d for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source. The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. \u201cAngie\u2019s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom\u2019s best man since Maddox sort of feels he\u2019s the man of the family now,\u201d the source said. Knox will allegedly be the ring bearer, and Pax will DJ and bake the cake for the reception (he did for his parents\u2019 wedding, too!) It all sounds lovely, but how will Brad react when he finds out?  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina\u2019s rep for comment.

        "Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up. There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore. And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months \u2014 even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada \u2014 it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down. So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting. \u00a37.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills. A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm. 'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals. 'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.' \u00a32million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There\u2019s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it\u2019s set at the end of a no-through road. Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes. Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area. 'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.' However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood. It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'. \u00a32.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry\u2019s boxes when it comes to privacy. There\u2019s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home. 'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary. 'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.' Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying \u00a32 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings. But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own. \u00a34.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'. Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate. The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a \u00a35 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015. Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court. 'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says. Locals have spotted the Prince \u2014 without his girlfriend \u2014 discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months. The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs. \u00a37.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff \u2014 a must for any royal retreat 'I'm not surprised he's moving here \u2014 he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.' Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds. Harry's royal duties require him to be close to London and Toronto-based Meghan, whose time on the U.S. TV series Suits is coming to an end, wouldn't cope well with",

        "Some reports suggest Ben Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus' relationship may have been going on even while they were still married to their respective spouses. A source tells ET that Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller -- a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. According to the source, Affleck and Shookus were seeing one another as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that he had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says. However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015. WATCH: 6 Things We Know About Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus Let's take a look back at Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship timeline. 2013: According to People, Affleck and Shookus started seeing one another in 2013, two years before Affleck and 45-year-old Garner announced their separation. Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013. Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took \"work.\" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss. One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC. \"He definitely looked interested in her,\" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar. Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015. Affleck and Shookus \"full-on had an affair,\" claims a source cited by People. \"They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide.\" \"Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,\" claims a second source the magazine quotes. \"Both of them were cheating on their spouses so they were very careful about it,\" the source alleges. X17online.com According to Us Weekly, the romance began just a few months after Shookus became a mom to her daughter with Miller. \"[Affleck and Shookus] were sleeping together, sending each other cute texts and meeting up whenever they could,\" an insider close to Garner and Affleck reportedly claims to the outlet. 2015: According to Us Weekly, Garner and Miller found out about the Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time in 2015. \"They were devastated when they found out about the affair,\" a source claims according to the magazine. However, a source close to Affleck tells Us Weekly, \"Lindsay was not what led to the end of their marriage. They had a ton of other problems.\" June 2015 -- Affleck and Garner separate Affleck and Garner announced their split on June 30, 2015. \"After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,\" the two said in their joint statement to ET. \"We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.\" July 2015 -- The nanny scandal Us Weekly broke the story on July 29, claiming that Affleck had secretly been dating Ouzounian, and that the two frequently texted and emailed after she was let go as his children's nanny. Earlier that month, Ouzounian tipped off the paparazzi, telling them she'd be at the L.A.-area rental house that Affleck was staying in at the time, a source later told ET. The former nanny was seen smiling wide as she handed Affleck a bottle of champagne during their late-night meetup. She also arrived at Affleck's in his Lexus, which she had also been seen driving earlier in the day while running errands. Affleck's rep slammed the reports, telling ET that \"all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue\" and that they are considering legal options. \"The story is complete garbage and full of lies,\" his rep stated. April 2017 -- Garner and Affleck officially file for divorce Affleck and Garner legally filed for divorce in April 2017, after a two-year separation. Still, the pair have made it clear that their three children -- Violet, Seraphina and Samuel -- remain their priority. Just one month earlier, Affleck thanked Garner for her support after announcing that he had just completed treatment for alcohol addiction. \"I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,\" he wrote in his statement on Facebook. July 2017 -- Affleck steps out with Shookus Affleck was photographed with Shookus for the first time on July 6, when the two had dinner at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Los Angeles. A source tells ET that Affleck's new relationship works \"really well,\" because Shookus \"has had experience with the Hollywood world.\" \"[She] knows what is expected of Ben, and how much of their relationship they can share publicly,\" the source explains. \"It puts Ben at ease knowing that Lindsay understands who he is. They have kept their relationship very low key and private.\" Another source also tells ET that much like Affleck and Garner, Shookus and her ex -- whom she married in 2010 -- are also \"extremely amicable.\" \"They live separately but",

        "The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3] Announcement of engagement [ edit ] Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[5] Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017 On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8] The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8] During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11] Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17] Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20] Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29] To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK \u00a35 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31] Wedding [ edit ] Planning [ edit ] Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST. Venue [ edit ] The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36] Cost [ edit ] The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be \u00a350,000, \u00a3110,000, and \u00a3286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around \u00a332 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent \u00a32.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to \u00a3500 million.[41] Wedding attire [ edit ] The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of \"Dress Uniform, Morning Coat",
        "CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that he believed both protesters and counter protesters were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY President Trump in Trump Tower. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of the story included a tweet from a parody account claiming to Jill Biden. NEW YORK CITY \u2013 President Trump's argument Tuesday that left wing groups were just as violent as the white supremacists who staged a demonstration in Charlottesville set off a firestorm of criticism from members of his own party \u2013 and raised questions about his personal views of racial tensions in the country. Just one day after Trump sought to tamp down on controversy by condemning white supremacists for their role in racially motivated clashes in the Virginia city, the president appeared to return to his highly criticized initial response that many sides were to blame for the weekend violence. \"What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right?\" Trump told reporters in a chaotic impromptu press conference at Trump Tower. \"Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?\" Trump said he couldn't make a condemnation of hate groups earlier because he didn't \"know all the facts\" about an alleged white nationalist who crashed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one person and wounded 19 others. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump told reporters that both sides were to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY \"I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct,\" Trump said from Trump Tower in New York, after an event that was intended to be devoted to a new infrastructure executive order. Trump has been especially quick to denounce previous terrorist attacks, including those taking place overseas. Yet he was notably reticent to pinpoint the blame for one on Saturday that involved white supremacists \u2013 a point his critics on both sides of the aisle continued to hammer. \"We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. added: \"There is only one side to be on when a white supremacist mob brutalizes and murders in America.\u201d Several lawmakers were dismayed the president appeared to equate white supremacists with their opponents. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., tweeted: \"Blaming 'both sides' for #Charlottesville?! No. Back to relativism when dealing with KKK, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists? Just no.\" Another Republican, Rep. Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, said Trump \"must stop the moral equivalency! AGAIN.\" Over the weekend, Trump faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for chiding \"many sides\" for their role in the violence in Charlottesville on Saturday, a statement many regarded as tepid toward racists. A full two days later, on Monday, Trump at the White House directly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and announced the Justice Department would open up a civil rights investigation into the driver of the car that killed Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer. Yet on Tuesday, amid questions about whether Trump meant the words behind his most recent scripted statement, the president called his initial response \"fine\" and blamed the press for being dishonest in its coverage. \"There was no way of making a correct statement that early,\" he said at one point. \"I had to see the facts. Unlike a lot of reporters \u2013 I didn't know (prominent white supremacist) David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts.\" For his part, former KKK leader Duke tweeted a thank you to the president after his statement Tuesday \u2013 for condemning \"the leftist terrorists\" in Black Lives Matter and Antifa. CLOSE From Trump Tower in New York City, President Trump defends his decision to delay responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. USA TODAY Trump also said \"not all of those people\" who attended the demonstration were not racist or neo-Nazi, but only wanted to protest the city's plans to remove the Robert E. Lee statue. That statement also drew catcalls from Republicans. \"If you're showing up to a Klan rally, you're probably a racist or a bigot,\" said Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., said on CNN. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that \"the organizers of events\" that led to the Charlottesville terror attack \"are 100% to blame.\" The white supremacists, Rubio tweeted, are \"adherents of an evil ideology which argues certain people are inferior because of race, ethnicity or nation of origin.... When (there's an) entire movement built on anger and hatred towards people different than you, it justifies and ultimately leads to violence against them.\" Rubio offered a direct message to Trump: \"Mr. President, you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame... (they) will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win. We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected.\" More: Trump distances himself from strategist Steve Bannon in wake of Charlottesville violence The president was slated to only discuss infrastructure during his appearances, but took questions from reporters for more than 15 minutes, most of them about Charlottesville. Some aides looked dismayed as he answered more questions. During a rollicking, impromptu news conference in which Trump and reporters frequently argued and interrupted each other, the president also: Questioned moves by local government to remove Confederate statues and monuments from public places Trump openly wondered whether tributes to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are at risk because they were slave owners. \"You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\" Trump said. On the other hand, Trump said local governments are free to make their own decisions on these issues.

        "Carlotta is a fictional character from Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel The Phantom of the Opera.  In the novel, she is a minor character hailing from Spain. The first time that she is mentioned in the novel is during the chapter \"The New Marguerite\", where it is revealed that she could not perform at the ceremony for the former managers. Later in the novel, she is threatened by Erik that if she performs at the Opera House \"a great misfortune will strike\". She shrugs the warning off and performs anyway. When she does, however, croaking noises come out of her mouth and the chandelier comes crashing down. Ashamed, she hides from the public view for a few weeks, before making a return to the opera house.  Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson in the original 1925 silent film with Lon Chaney. In 1929, new sound scenes were filmed and Mary Fabian was recast as Carlotta, due to the fact that she could sing. Virginia Pearson still appeared in new scenes, now playing Carlotta's mother. These changes are also the same in the 1929 silent, foreign cut of the film (which is most commonly viewed).  In the 1943 film version, she is Mme. Biancarolli who has been drugged by the Phantom and murdered along with her maid when she tries to force him to take off his prop mask.  In Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, Carlotta (last name Giudicelli) is from Italy and is one of the major singing parts. The opera company's prima donna, she despises Christine Daa\u00e9 and sees the younger woman as a threat to her job and Phantom\u00b4s courtesan, when Christine achieves prominence due to the Phantom's dirty tricks. Carlotta and tenor Ubaldo Piangi are lovers; she often turns to him for consolation when things go wrong, and she breaks down crying when his murdered body is discovered onstage. The film reveals that she likes poodles.  In the Lloyd Webber-Joel Schumacher 2004 film version, she was played by Minnie Driver.[1] Due to Driver's lack of experience in opera, her singing voice was dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, although she lent her actual voice to the song \"Learn to Be Lonely\" during the end credits.  In Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer, the characters of Carlotta and La Sorelli are combined into one, despite being mentioned as separate characters in the original novel. In Kim Newman's short story \"Angels of Music\" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Carlotta is implied to be the ancestor of Bianca Castafiore from The Adventures of Tintin comic series.",
        "Demure: Lindsay Lohan certainly looked the part as she attended London Modest Fashion Week in the capital on Sunday(Source: aidijuma - Instagram) She sparked rumours she had converted to Islam when she changed her Instagram bio to 'Alaikum salam' in January, which translates to 'and unto you peace' in Arabic. And Lindsay Lohan certainly looked the part as she attended a London Modest Fashion Week event in the capital on Sunday. The American Mean Girls actress, 31, opted to wear a hijab for the event, conforming to the event's theme- which showcases the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines. Letting a glimpse of her trademark flame hair shine through, the head piece perfectly framed her pretty face, accentuated by a touch of lipgloss and eyebrow pencil. She teamed it with a black bomber jacket and black trousers as she stopped to check out the cosmetics. The actress was seen posing with excited fans at the event, before making a quiet exit. Sharing a snap of the actress with their goodie bag, a beauty brand from the event later wrote: 'She was so lovely and was saying how she's into halal cosmetics and what she\u2019s actually wearing on her face today was all halal!!'

Modest: The American Mean Girls actress, 31, opted to wear a hijab for the event, conforming to the event's theme- which showcases the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines London Modest Fashion week kicked off this weekend, showcasing the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines. The second installment of the two-day event, held at Victoria House, Bloomsbury, saw models parading down the runway in demure clothing. Running alongside London Fashion week, the event, which charges up to \u00a3200 for tickets, features shopping, runway shows, talks and workshops - including a 'sharia legal hub'. More than 40 designers from around the world showcased scarves, hijabs and loose-fitting maxi dresses at the annual style showcase organised by Haute Elan, who say 'modest fashion' is one of the fastest-growing consumer markets. In January Lindsay deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio, changing her bio to 'Alaikum salam.' A new angle: London Modest Fashion week kicked off this weekend, running alongside London Fashion week The Arabic greeting translates to 'and unto you peace,' and many took it mean that Lohan was converting to the Muslim faith. Lohan has not revealed however if she is in fact converting to the faith, and a rep for the actress did not respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. There were previously rumors that Lohan might be converting back in 2015 when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran while doing community service in Brooklyn. When appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the book was actually just a gift from some friends. 'My very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Quran and I brought it to New York because I was learning,' said Lohan. Rare picture: In January Lindsay deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio, changing her bio to 'Alaikum salam.' (seen in her latest new Instagram post) 'It opened doors for me to experience spiritually, to find another true meaning. This is who I am.' She said however that she was attacked after that picture was released in the media. 'They crucified me for it in America. They made me seem like Satan. I was a bad person for holding that Quran,' said Lohan. She said that she was then happy to leave and return to London because she felt unsafe in [her] country. Lohan spent time in October of last year visiting child refugees who had fled Syria and crossed over into Turkey. She told Page Six last month that she was hoping to return to Turkey again either before of after the start of the new year. 'The dates are not set yet. It depends on how Turkey feels after the recent terrorist attack in Istanbul,' said Lohan, 'Not that any attack has or will ever stop me from helping those suffering, those who need our help the most.' She then added: 'I miss my family a lot, but they are very supportive and understanding of the fact that my main focus is business, writing and soon to start another film. More so, my work with refugees.' Just a few days before her account was wiped clean in January 2017, Lindsay had shared a poem in which she said she wanted to 'fix ISIS minds'. 'Sometimes I hear the voice of the one I loved the most. But in this world we live in on terror,' the poem went. 'Who i am to be the girl who is scared and hurt, when most things that happen i cannot explain. 'I try to understand, when i'm sitting in bed alone at 3am. So i can't sleep, i roll over. I can't think and my body becomes cold. I immediately feel older..... 'Than [sic] i realize, at least I am in a bed. I am still alive. So what can really be said? Just go to bed and close the blinds.

Among the many topics discussed between host and ex-sex tape star, of course, was the dishonesty and infidelity of Tristan Thompson.  As previously cited, Kardashian said simply that Thompson cheating on sister Khloe Kardashian was just so \"f-cked up,\" a term she apologized for using on air.  But an appropriate term nonetheless, right?  Elsewhere in this sit-down, Kim described the entire situation as \"sad,\" while not exactly answering Ellen directly when asked if she EVER liked Thompson.  Instead, she rambled on about how Khloe often \"dives in\" to romances and the family supports her as best they can.  Interesting, right?  As for other subjects touched on in this semi-revealing Q&A?  Kim wanted to initially name her third child Jo or Grace.  Kanye played the game Connect 4 during Chicago's delivery.

According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating. This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato\u2019s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality\u2013 despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Demi Lovato\u2019s sexuality: 1.

She\u2019s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song \u201cCatch Me\u201d on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley\u2019s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed \u201cBFF,\u201d in 2010. Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70\u2019s Show actor: When I dated white guys, it wasn\u2019t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that\u2019s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He\u2019s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he\u2019s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I\u2019ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend. Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato\u2019s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme \u201cBomba\u201d Vasconcelos and Abedini. 3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato \u2018Hooked Up\u2019 in 2013 In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. \u201cI\u2019m like the one person demi has slept with that didn\u2019t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,\u201d Rose tweeted out.

I liked the hair.\u201d Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama. A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. \u201cRumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.\u201d The singer added \u201cWhether there\u2019s been rumours with one specific person or not, that\u2019s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.\u201d 4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community.

The singer is looking out for her girl, Khloe Kardashian, and wants her to know she\u2019s risking \u2018serious heartbreak\u2019 trusting Tristan Thompson with his ex. Read on for all the EXCLUSIVE details.  Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she\u2019s not careful.  \u201cIggy\u2019s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she\u2019s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she\u2019s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,\u201d a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cIggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don\u2019t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.\u201d  \u201cIggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant \u2013 again,\u201d the source continued. \u201cShe\u2019s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did.

        "Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History \u2013 despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump\u2019s products weren\u2019t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter\u2019s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump\u2019s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst\u2019s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 \u2014 the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump\u2019s clothing and jewelry line on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff is what I would tell you,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI\u2019m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.\u201d And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump\u2019s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that \u201cthe beginning of February\u201d shows \u201cthe best performing weeks in the history of the brand.\u201d \u201cFor several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,\u201d Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst\u2019s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter\u2019s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was \u201clargely featured\u201d in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had \u201cbeen treated so unfairly\u201d by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. \u201cIt would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,\u201d Tanner said of Conway\u2019s Fox interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.\u201d Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely wrong, wrong, wrong\u201d and \u201cclearly over the line,\u201d The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been \u201ccounseled.\u201d But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government\u2019s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post\u2019s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president\u2019s deputy counsel. \u201cWhen an employee\u2019s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,\u201d Shaub wrote. \u201cNot taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.\u201d [A Trump voter\u2019s message to retailers: \u2018Keep your mouths shut about our president\u2019] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway \u2014 a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar \u2014 partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump\u2019s products. According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen such a large uptick,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cTypically, she\u2019s not in our top 100 sellers.\u201d Comparing February\u2019s numbers with last year\u2019s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.) The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company\u2019s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst. [Watchdogs ask U.S. attorney to investigate Trump over foreign business deals] The Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products. 1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Ivanka Trump: A life in the spotlight View Photos Here\u2019s a look at Ivanka Trump\u2019s early life of privilege and transformation into a business executive, first daughter and adviser to the U.S. president.

        "No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  \u201cI do believe in marriage,\u201d the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. \u201cAnd I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I\u2019m not forcing anything right now.\u201d  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other\u2019s lives in a way that most other people couldn\u2019t.\u201d  She added: \u201cWe both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.\u201d  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single \u201cUs\u201d written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for one year today. I don\u2019t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song\u2019s for you. I love you,\u201d she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: \u201cThey played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, \u2018Oh, this is relevant!\u2019 Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, \u2018Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?\u2019\u201d  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the \u201cDance Again\u201d songstress\u2019 life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. \u201cWhen I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cI know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I\u2019m glad I can do that now.\u201d  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. \u201cBaseball is just like life,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you want to do is hit a home run.\u201d  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",
        "Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years \u2014 not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world\u2019s most famous \u201cunsinkable\u201d ship \u2014 which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people \u2014 is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer \u2014 not J. Bruce Ismay \u2014 is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  \u201cThe new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you\u2019d expect on a 21st-century ship,\u201d James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer\u2019s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers \u2014 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers \u2014 from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers\u2019 relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets \u2014 with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.",

        "The pair became close friends on set when they filmed Netflix show Maniac and Jen is said to be wondering whether they have been dating while she and Justin were still a couple.  \u2018Justin and Emma did a movie together last year, so Jen is of course now wondering whether they hooked up back then - when Justin and Jen were still married,\u2019 spills the source.  \u2018It\u2019s certainly not the first time Jen\u2019s seen her husband fall for another actress on set, so of course she\u2019s wary. It happened with Brad and Angelina \u2013 so Jen can\u2019t help but think history is repeating itself,\u2019 the insider says.  To add insult to injury, Jen has been close to Emma for a while and with these recent revelations, Jen feels her pal has been disloyal.  \u2018She and Emma have been friends \u2013 the fact that she\u2019s now hanging with Jen\u2019s ex-husband is a complete betrayal. Emma has obviously chosen to side with Justin after the whole split, which is very telling to Jen considering that she\u2019s been friends with Emma.  \u2018She just wants to know when their hook-ups started \u2013 they looked so cosy and happy on their date, like this definitely wasn\u2019t their first night out,\u2019 the source continues.  \u2018Jen just feels completely humiliated, like she\u2019s being played for a fool \u2013 and she doesn\u2019t like it one little bit.\u2019  Jen and Justin called it quits in February this year and he has stayed friends with Emma since.  Justin even posted the two of them hanging out onto his Instagram, but he was quick to declare they were \u2018just friends\u2019.  But just a month after announcing his split from Jen, Justin was seen at the Louis Vuitton show beside Emma.  He has also been linked to various other women including actress Aubrey Plaza and artist Petra Collins, while Emma is said to be dating writer Dave McCarthy since last year.  In the meantime, Jen has been rumoured to be back together again with her ex-husband Brad Pitt who recently finalised his divorce from Angelina Jolie.  Jen is also alleged to be pregnant with Brad\u2019s child and was spotted getting off a private plane a few weeks back, hiding what seemed to be a baby bump.  But the news comes amid controversy that Brad Pitt is secretly dating beautiful architect Neri Oxman, leaving Jen to possibly consider raising their baby alone.  Jen and Justin have remained estranged since the split and sources tell New Idea the pair had an explosive showdown a few weeks ago as he returned to their Bel Air mansion to collect the rest of his belongings.  Now with the recent release of the pictures of Justin\u2019s cosy date with Emma, the relationship with Jen is certain to become even more frosty.

        "Today in unexpected couples, Emma Stone has been spotted on vacation in the South of France with Justin Theroux.  Since he split from Jennifer Aniston in February, Theroux has been linked to a number of different women, including Selena Gomez, Aubrey Plaza, and Petra Collins.

Theroux and Stone are co-stars in Netflix's forthcoming series, Maniac, and have been spending a lot of time together as a result. However, rumors that the pair might be more than friends started earlier this month when they were seen leaving a Met Gala after-party together.  E! also notes that Theroux shared a photo of Stone in one of his Instagram Stories earlier this month, as the pair posed with Jonathan Van Ness from Netflix's Queer Eye reboot. Theroux did his best to quell dating rumors, though, captioning the photo, \"Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs.\"  To make matters more confusing, Theroux was also seen looking extremely close to Harrier, who is on vacation with Stone, and also attended the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show.

        "Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her \u201clongtime\u201d tour promoter told Billboard, \u201cBy the time all the tickets are sold next week, I\u2019ll be celebrating Taylor\u2019s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.\u201d But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post\u2019s headline, \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,\u201d is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company\u2019s \u201cVerified Fan\u201d program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents\u2019 credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could \u201cimprove [their] position in line to purchase tickets.\u201d And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  \u201cI paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,\u201d one fan wrote. \u201cNow for the same seats I have to pay about $500.\u201d  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry\u2019s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.",

        "This article is about the television series. For the novel, see Thirteen Reasons Why 13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The series revolves around seventeen year old high school student, Clay Jensen, and his deceased female friend Hannah Baker, who has committed suicide after failing to cope with the culture, gossip and lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners. Dylan Minnette stars as Clay, while Katherine Langford plays Hannah. Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James also star. A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.[2] In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers. Premise [ edit ] In season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies. In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavours to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favour of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah. Throughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device. Cast and characters [ edit ] Main [ edit ] Recurring [ edit ] Introduced in season one [ edit ] Josh Hamilton as Matt Jensen, Clay's father, a psychologist. Michele Selene Ang as Courtney Crimsen, a closeted student at Liberty High who is responsible for spreading rumors about Hannah to protect the secret of her own sexual orientation. In season 2, she comes out on the stand during the trial of Hannah Baker, confessing her actions against Hannah that landed her on the tapes. Steven Silver as Marcus Cole, the self-centered student body president at Liberty High, who is responsible for humiliating and attempting to sexually assault Hannah on a date. In season 2, he is suspended from school after lying on the stand during the trial and following the leaked release of the tapes soon after. Ajiona Alexus as Sheri Holland, a student and cheerleader at Liberty High who forms a bond with Clay but is also on the tapes when her actions result in Jeff's accidental death. Tommy Dorfman as Ryan Shaver, a student at Liberty High who betrayed Hannah's trust. Sosie Bacon as Skye Miller, an estranged friend of Clay. In the second season, Skye and Clay date for while before she leaves for a \"fresh start\", following another self-harm incident which resulted in her bipolar disorder diagnosis. Timothy Granaderos as Montgomery de la Cruz, a bully who is a student at Liberty High. In season 2, he secretly terrorizes a number of individuals testifying at Hannah Baker's trial.

        "There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the \"Wildest Dreams\" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, \u201cTaylor was so young when they dated, she wasn\u2019t ready for a serious relationship, but now she\u2019s showing Jake how much she\u2019s matured. She\u2019s excited to see where things go.\u201d  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, \u201cHe said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor\u2019s new number. They\u2019ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.\"  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  \u201cThis guy walks in who is a friend of my ex\u2019s and starts talking about how he\u2019s heard we\u2019re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together \u2014 just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, \u2018This is what we\u2019re writing,\u2019\u201d she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: \"I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.\"  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was \"no truth\" to the report.  Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.",

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: \"What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?\"  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: \"No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.\"  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: \"I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.\"  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: \"I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.\"  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members\u2019 club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.  On Sunday he said Argentina was \u201ccrazy\u201d and told the fans there he loved them after Saturday\u2019s gig.  3am has contacted Bieber for a comment.",
        "Can Kimye last long-term if Kanye\u2019s besties, Jay-Z and Beyonce, keep giving her the cold shoulder? Or can friends \u201ckill\u201d a love affair?  On last Sunday\u2019s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will \u201cKimye\u201d stand a chance?  Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye\u2019s friends like her. It will be Kanye\u2019s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.  If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.  Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.  If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.  Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don\u2019t hate. There is a strong chance a friend will be lost.  Diana Falzone  More Kim Kardashian and Beyonce Feud",

The talk show host on Sunday posted a photo on Instagram of him and his wife boarding a private jet.  \u201cVacation time is here, let\u2019s go girl,\u201d he captioned the Sunday, July 8 image.

        "Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn\u2019t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton\u2019s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here\u2019s everything we know about Middleton\u2019s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton\u2019s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three \u2014 who gave birth to a second baby boy in April \u2014 is worth at least \u00a35 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as \u00a37.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton\u2019s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn\u2019t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton\u2019s net worth is a lot less than her prince \u2014 Wealth-X estimates Prince William\u2019s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William\u2019s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal \u2014 an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson\u2014Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton\u2019s money?  Most of Middleton\u2019s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around \u00a330 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least \u00a3250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew\u2019s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton\u2019s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth \u00a31 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson\u2014Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn\u2019t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family\u2019s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money \u2014 her net worth is believed to be about $5 million \u2014 as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the \u2018Kate effect\u2019?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as \u201cthe Kate Effect,\u201d ",

        "R. Kelly\u2019s time may have finally come. R. Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive \u201csex cult\u201d of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly\u2019s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would \u201cwork diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.\u201d) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of \u201cknowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.\u201d Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he \u201ccategorically denies all claims and allegations.\u201d As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there\u2019s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly\u2019s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he\u2019s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year\u2019s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a \u201cchild molester\u201d in an interview with Complex, insisting, \u201cHe pees on people.\u201d In our post-#MeToo, post-Time\u2019s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples\u2019s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, \u201cWe can\u2019t ever talk about this guy. ... You\u2019re about to get me fired from Coachella. It\u2019s my first time here.\u201d Later, Staples tweeted that \u201cR. Kelly people is looking for me.\u201d ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ \u2014 andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018 That stasis may be starting to change. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly\u2019s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: \u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a shitbag.\u201d In April, the Women of Color committee within Time\u2019s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly\u2019s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly\u2019s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It\u2019s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he\u2019s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that\u2019s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R. Kelly that makes it possible to forget exactly what he\u2019s been accused of, how often he\u2019s been accused, and how much proof there is against him. And most likely, that\u2019s because his alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and hence apparently easy for America to ignore. \u201cThe saddest fact I\u2019ve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women,\u201d says Jim DeRogatis, the reporter who broke the R. Kelly story. \u201cNobody.\u201d To try to combat that vagueness and the erasure that it makes possible, here is a timeline of all of the accusations of sexual misconduct against R. Kelly. Much of the chronology here is drawn from DeRogatis\u2019s invaluable coverage of the R. Kelly accusations, including his own immensely thorough timeline. DeRogatis\u2019s timeline covers the entire span of Kelly\u2019s life, including his major career milestones and unrelated legal issues, but I\u2019ve narrowed the focus of this timeline to specifically the sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly. Over the 24-year span of this timeline, a consistent pattern emerges. Over and over again, Kelly is accused of the same behavior: of targeting girls and very young women, isolating them, and controlling and abusing them. And after the dust from the accusation settles, Kelly goes on living his life with very few changes. Here, from Aaliyah to the alleged sex cult, are all the R. Kelly accusations. August 30, 1994: 27-year-old R. Kelly marries 15-year-old Aaliyah The \u201990s music sensation Aaliyah was Kelly\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. They met when she was 12 years old, and Kelly wrote and produced her first album in 1993. It was titled Age Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number. In 1995, Vibe magazine published a copy of their marriage license, with 15-year-old Aaliyah falsely listing her age as 18. \u201cFamily members say Aaliyah thought it was all an elaborate \u2018game,\u2019 and she just went along with it,\u201d the Chicago Sun-Times later reported, adding that the marriage license was reportedly obtained by Kelly\u2019s assistant, using a fake ID. \u201cWithin hours, she realized what had happened, and she went to her family and sought their help.\u201d The marriage was annulled in 1994, just months after the ceremony. In the settlement, according to documents obtained by the Sun-Times, Aaliyah promises not to pursue further legal action because of \u201cemotional distress caused",
        "Media playback is not supported on this device 'I would hope that I would win against Serena'  Serena Williams disputes John McEnroe's claims that she would struggle to be in the world's top 700 if she was on the men's circuit.  But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: \"If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.\"  He qualified the comments by saying: \"That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.\"  But he added: \"I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.\"  Williams later responded on Twitter: \"Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  \"I've never played anyone ranked \"there\" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.\"  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was \"trying to talk women's tennis down\" but said \"the reality\" was that \"men are stronger in general\".  \"I would hope that I would win against Serena,\" he added.  \"It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  \"It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  \"I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.\"  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2.",

        "What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA\u2019s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.  The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant\u2019s \u201celite\u201d patrons.  CANNIBALISM \u2018MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK\u2019  Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that \u201cCannibalism is way more popular than you might think\u201d and \u201chuman flesh is the best meat\u201c, is also a regular diner.  Boasting that the restaurant is the \u201ccutting edge of experimental cuisine\u201d and serves \u201cL.A.\u2019s cultural elite\u201c, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they \u201cspecialize in the preparation of human meat\u201d that comes from \u201cyoung and healthy bodies.\u201c  Cannibal Club\u2019s visiting chefs \u201chail from around the world\u201d and come to L.A. to \u201cpractice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,\u201d according to the Cannibal Club website.  \u2018FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES\u2019  \u201cOur exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.  \u201cAt Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.\u201c  Describing each dish as a \u201cstudy in taste and elegance\u201c, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: \u201cThe meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.\u201d  But don\u2019t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:  \u201cIt is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.\u201c  HUMAN MEAT MENU  The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (\u201ca Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver\u201c) and Placenta Lasagne (\u201can otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano\u201d.)

On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.\u201c  The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness.

The pair had a public two-year romance. Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, \u201c[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn\u2019t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he\u2019s remorseful for how he treated me.\u201d Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. \u201cMost amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,\u201d Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna\u2019s giant diamond ring. Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian\u2019s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!). Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose As West\u2019s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fianc\u00e9, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song \u201cCold\u201d in which he rapped, \u201cOnly n\u2014a I got respect for is Wiz / And I\u2019ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.\u201d Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter.

Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014. Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar Things got awkward when Kim\u2019s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim\u2019s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family\u2019s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He\u2019s stayed out of the public eye ever since. \u201cHe sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,\u201d Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. \u201cThere was no fight.\u201d Blac Chyna and Tyga Split In August 2014, the parents called it quits. \u201cThey are trying to keep it amicable,\u201d an insider told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cThey also have a lot of friends in common \u2014 Tyga is Kanye [West\u2019s] boy and Blac Chyna got close to [his wife] Kim [Kardashian] \u2014 so they don\u2019t want to make it weird.\u201d Amber Rose Splits From Wiz Khalifa Despite previously saying she wanted to be with Khalifa \u201cfor the rest of my life,\u201d Rose filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after they tied the knot. \u201cI never knew what a true heartache felt like until now,\u201d Rose tweeted several weeks later. Tyga Starts Dating Kylie Jenner In the fall of 2014, Tyga and the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan sparked a series of dating rumors after they were seen hanging out together regularly. In August 2014, Tyga hosted Kylie Jenner\u2019s 17th birthday party, and they continued to be spotted out together as the months went on. However, due to Jenner\u2019s underage status, the couple never publicly acknowledged their romance. Amber Rose Slams Kylie Jenner and Tyga Fresh off her split from Khalifa, Rose befriended Chyna, who was now estranged from Kim after the Tyga/Kylie dating rumors. In February 2015, Rose appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she gave her unfiltered thoughts on Jenner\u2019s relationship with Tyga. \u201cShe\u2019s a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o\u2019clock and relax,\u201d Rose said of Jenner. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice\u2019s deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud.

She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,\u201d the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.

The \u201cCake By The Ocean\u201d singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George.

Joe\u2019s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl.

It\u2019s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she \u201cchose\u201d to take care of herself, \u201cnot to prove anything to anyone.\u201d Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn\u2019t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He\u2019s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year\u2019s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber\u2019s birthday on March 1, according to reports.",
        "Oh boy.  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He\u2019s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it\u2019s all said and done. On Liam\u2019s first single, \u201cStrip That Down,\u201d he\u2019s dissed One Direction plain as day. \u201cYou know I used to be in 1D, now I\u2019m out free,\u201d he sings. \u201cPeople want me for one thing, that\u2019s not me. I\u2019m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.\u201d    But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan\u2019s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s not my sort of music. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d listen to,\u201d he said. But he did have a quick save: \u201cI think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That\u2019s the way I\u2019d put it best, I think.\u201d Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn\u2019t listen to hip-hop. \u201cMy song\u2019s more \u2018Rack City\u2019 and his song is more of a different era to something I\u2019d listen to, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cStrip That Down\u201d does feature a rapper, Migos\u2019s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.",
        "Now, it\u2019s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year\u2019s Star Wars: Episode IX.  In a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use \u201cunseen footage we shot together in Episode VII\u201d and assuring fans that \u201cwe were never going to recast, or use a CG character.\u201d While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher \u2014 or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa \u2014 will play in the movie.  Firstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia\u2019s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can\u2019t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there\u2019s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.  Considering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D\u2019Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she\u2019s very much in \u201charried leader\u201d mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we\u2019ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?  (It\u2019s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)  Abrams\u2019 comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that\u2019s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?  Of course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they\u2019ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm \u2014 and Fisher\u2019s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams\u2019 statement \u2014 want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they\u2019re courting backlash if this isn\u2019t done perfectly.  That the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It\u2019s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology \u2014 and loved Fisher as a person \u2014 as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.  Everyone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.",

        "Caitlyn Jenner is putting her foot down and has refused to watch Megyn Kelly\u2019s highly anticipated interview with the Kardashian and Jenner clans that is set to air in June.  Last week, pictures surfaced on TMZ that showed Mrs. Kelly, the new face of NBC, on the Los Angeles set of \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d after conducting a lengthy interview with Kris Jenner and all of her daughters \u2013 Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kourtney, Kim, and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.  It was made known that Caitlyn Jenner and Rob Kardashian had opted to skip the chitchat and for obvious reasons, Blac Chyna and Tyga were not invited.

The retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, who is currently promoting her new memoir, \u201cThe Secrets of My Life,\u201d is embroiled in a nasty fight with ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and is said to be allergic to all things Kardashian.

She knows they aren\u2019t going to say nice things about her, so why subject herself to the insults.\u201d  The tipster went on to explain that the 67-year-old television personality is upset that her daughters \u2013 Kendall and Kylie \u2013 took part in the charade.  The person revealed: \u201cShe\u2019s hoping her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, were able to persuade their mother not to discuss Caitlyn in-depth.Caitlyn thinks is awful that Kris is basically calling her a liar and possibly damaging her relationship with the girls.\u201d  Kourt looking for zero fucks to give on her 38th bday looking soooo good A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Apr 18, 2017 at 7:34pm PDT  On the April 28th episode of \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d Kim slammed Caitlyn for attacking her family in her new memoir and for insulting her mother.

        "I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in \u201cThe Town\u201d features the \u201cBride Wars\u201d of Boston accents. Her performance in \u201cThe Age of Adaline\u201d \u2014 as a woman \u201ccursed\u201d to stay 30 forever \u2014 was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn\u2019t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it\u2019s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something \u2014 beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I\u2019d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don\u2019t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he\u2019s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else\u2019s turn to be \u201cit.\u201d (It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn\u2019t done with that.",

        "It was a humid 84 degrees in Bridgehampton on Saturday, but that didn\u2019t stop a crowd of people from descending upon Topping Rose House for Jill Zarin\u2019s annual luncheon. The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.  Scattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin\u2019s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.

That\u2019s not what our relationship was like,\u201d she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. \u201cI\u2019m walking down the street and someone\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!\u2019\u201d  She also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, and I live in London so it\u2019s good for her to have a distraction.\u201d  Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay\u2019s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules\u2013inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan\u2019s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.  \u201cThese kids were like, babies, and now they\u2019re running the show,\u201d she said of the crew. \u201cThey lived in my house! And now they\u2019re all corporate. . . . We\u2019re home. It\u2019s cyclical, you know.\u201d  Lohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay\u2019s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.  A friend of Lohan\u2019s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.  \u201cShe\u2019s in New York with me,\u201d the matriarch answered. \u201cI keep them close! I\u2019m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!\u201d  Finally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She\u2019s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of \u201cpet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive\u201d rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs.

She showed up 90 minutes late for the event and refused to walk the red carpet.  'She also insisted on only having her picture taken in a special room with her chosen photographer rather than alongside all the other stars at the bash. She was behaving like a diva.'

        "Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music\u2019s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton \u2014 aka the rocker and the country boy \u2014 have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing \u2026 they\u2019re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his \u201cCountry Music Freaks\u201d trek.      This isn\u2019t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton\u2019s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 \u2014 when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu \u2014 and shared his latest video, \u201cI Lived It\u201d with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch\u2018s \u201cinsider\u201d source, all of Stefani\u2019s social media support is \u201ca desperate attempt to ignore the truth,\u201d and Shelton dumped her due to her \u201cneediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.\u201d  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup \u2014 Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani\u2019s comfort \u2014 as well as Shelton\u2019s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is \u201csharing intimate details\u201d of his life.  Shelton isn\u2019t reciprocating Stefani\u2019s loving social media deluge \u2014 but then again, he\u2019s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",
        "Postby Guest \u00bb Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm  So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that",

        "Lady Gaga Alberto E. Rodriguez/ Getty Images  The INSIDER Summary:  Lady Gaga's new documentary will discuss her struggles with chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from \"chronic pain\" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, \"Gaga: Five Foot Two,\" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, \" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,\" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people \"physically, mentally, and socially.\" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.  George Clooney Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla  In addition to Gaga, Morgan Freeman has specifically spoken about dealing with fibromyalgia. In an interview with Esquire, the actor described the pain. \"Up and down the arm,\" he said. \"That's where it gets so bad. Excruciating.\" The actor doesn't let this pain stop him from doing some of the things he enjoys like golfing or walking, but he can't fly pilot jets or drive.  According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the \"pain is a microphone\" and it \"does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,\" Variety reports. Here's hoping \"Gaga: Five Foot Two,\" which will be available on September 22 on Netflix, inspires others suffering to transform the pain.",
        "Reverend Swadley \u2013 the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family \u2013 has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad\u2019s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It\u2019s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad\u2019s mum, Jane, who she\u2019d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it\u2019s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley \u2013 hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  \u2018Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad\u2019s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,\u2019 a close friend of the pastor\u2019s told New Idea exclusively.  \u2018Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend\u2019s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  \u2018He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she\u2019s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad\u2019s \u2013 and their \u2013 lives.\u2019  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  \u2018Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,\u2019 the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad\u2019s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  \u2018Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad\u2019s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,\u2019 a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  \u2018He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they\u2019d been brought back together. And how they\u2019ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed \u2013 with Jen\u2019s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.\u2019  It\u2019s the latest chapter in the pair\u2019s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It\u2019s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  \u2018Brad\u2019s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,\u2019 says a source close to Brad. \u2018They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn\u2019t be happier.  \u2018And for Brad, seeing how much his children \u2013 especially Shiloh \u2013 love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  \u2018We\u2019re pretty sure they\u2019ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That\u2019s all that they want.\u2019  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",

In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said \"Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?\"    'And I said\u2026 \"OK\" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father\u2019s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low\u2026 YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father\u2019s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.  'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than anything, but adored each other as well.

        "Dakota Johnson; most of us know her as the actress from Fifty Shades of Grey. While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there\u2019s definitely a lot we don\u2019t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love\u2014Valentine's Day\u2014it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine\u2019s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, \"that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey.\" We guarantee that she will no longer by \"that girl\" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren\u2019t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. \"It was the only way that I could be with them,\" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. \"And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor.\" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that\u2019s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We\u2019ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She\u2019s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we\u2019re pleased to hear that she\u2019s following in her grandmother\u2019s footsteps\u2014both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It\u2019s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we\u2019re happy to hear of Dakota\u2019s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it\u2019s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad\u2019s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn\u2019t at her father\u2019s house, she was at her mom\u2019s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they\u2019re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it\u2019s great to hear of Dakota\u2019s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she\u2019s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn\u2019t just date. That probably explains why she\u2019s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it\u2019s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they\u2019ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude. The commitment is great and saves you a lot of time. 11 She HATED School It seems like we have something in common with Dakota Johnson: a loathing of school. Okay, so maybe not all of you hated school - many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school. But most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion. We all have our reasons why. Johnson, for instance, hated school because she felt like an \"alien.\" She said she didn\u2019t understand the process of school as a child and felt \"suffocated.\" I don't know about you guys, but I can totally relate with Dakota on this. Many of us felt like we didn\u2019t really fit in at school so it\u2019s especially comforting to hear that a big name like Dakota Johnson also felt like a social outcast in class. Like many of us, she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school. But hey, we admire her honesty. 10 Auditioning Gives Her Panic Attacks advertising Watching the pristine-looking A-list celebrities gliding around the Golden Globes Award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with self-doubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem. If only we could possess as much poise! The truth is, many of these celebrities don\u2019t feel that way at all; confident and self assured, that is. Dakota Johnson, for example, gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks. And we\u2019re not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there, we\u2019re talking full-on panic attacks\u2014the real deal. So before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than you\u2019ll ever be, just remember something: every single one of them suffers from self-doubt at one point or another. It happens to all of",
        "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) \u2014 Blake Griffin\u2019s injury-plagued career will now take him to Detroit after being traded to the Pistons on Monday, and the question of a career decline and a link to a certain celebrity family has surfaced.  The Pistons will send forward Tobias Harris, guard Avery Bradley and center Boban Marjanovic to Los Angeles, with the Clippers also receiving draft picks. Detroit also would receive forward Brice Johnson and center Willie Reed.

        "Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It\u2019s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won\u2019t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they\u2019re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  \u201cI am youthful and timeless at every age,\u201d Lopez says every single day\u2014but it\u2019s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. \u201cI tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clich\u00e9d bullshit, but it\u2019s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.\u201d  Lopez continues, \u201cThe affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they\u2019re all here. They\u2019re just part of the house now.\u201d  Before you scoff at Lopez\u2019s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that \u201cwhen pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.\u201d  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what\u2019s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.",
        "Taylor Swift performs during her '1989' Secret Session with iHeartRadio on Oct. 27, 2014 in New York City. (Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)  A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  \"I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,\" Swift said. \"I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.\"  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  \"I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,\" Swift told the View co-hosts. \"I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.\"  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  \"It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,\" Swift said. \"I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.\"  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.  \"How do you not know how awesome you are?\" Nicolle Wallace asked.  \"I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,\" said Swift.

        "The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert\u2019s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert\u2019s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump\u2019s mouth is good for \u201cis being Vladimir Putin\u2019s [expletive] holster.\u201d The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert\u2019s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it \u2013 minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert \u201cno-talent guy.\u201d Colbert\u2019s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: \u201cConsistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.\u201d  \u201cThe Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC\u2019s rules.\u201d  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are \u201cindecent.\u201d Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled \u201cobscene\u201d for stations to be fined.

Background: Washington Post: How Mike Flynn Was Undone By A Phone Call    \"We\u2019re going after this aggressively,\" Sessions said about the leak of the transcript of Flynn's call. \"I am directing it personally... and we\u2019re pursuing it aggressively.\"            Sessions also said that there are currently 27 open investigations regarding leaks of classified information. \"In the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27,\" he noted.

        "It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.  Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about \"karma\" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  \"Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It\u2019s karma!!\" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  \"You know, I\u2019ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,\" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  \"I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,\" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, \"I\u2019m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn\u2019t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don\u2019t know why he thinks it's karma.\"  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she \"was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.\"  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The \"Tin Man\" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's \"Livin\u2019 Like Hippies\" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.

Pretty much every person I know who's got famous is completely nuts. It's just isolation and also the repetitiveness of your interactions with people... It's just weird.\"  But he also explained how he maintained his own sanity. \"I had good agents and stuff and I've had really good friends since the beginning.\"  \"So I think when it gets dangerous for people is when you have no friends and you think, 'Oh, if I get strangers to love me then it will fill that hole.' And then when it doesn't fill the hole, then you go 10 times crazier,'\" he said.  Adding, \"I try to not be seen whatsoever between movies. So hopefully the only thing that exists of you in the public realm is what you agree to put out there.\"  Talking about his mental condition, he admitted that he was really crazy earlier. \"It's always just a control thing.

His new album, ye, doesn\u2019t merit any similar mercy.

The opening track \u2018I Thought About Killing You\u2019, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on \u2018No Mistakes\u2019, to keep his fans just interested enough. It\u2019s telling that the one standout track, \u2018Ghost Town\u2019 is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn\u2019t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it.

News exclusively before the \"Battle Rounds\" began, Blake recalled the double date he and Gwen went on with Kelly and her husband Brandon Blackstock. The reason he enjoyed it so much may surprise you.  \"It's fun to be around Kelly because there's that part of Kelly that I love about her\u2014she's still such a fan of artists,\" he shared with Sibley Scoles. \"One of my favorite times is to see her around Gwen...it's fun for me to see that fan, freak-out side of Kelly. She makes everything fun.\"",

        "Kim Kardashian is NOT upset about Kanye West working on a cosmetics line, despite a seemingly fabricated report. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust the story.  \"Kim Kardashian Worried Kanye West Is Working Too Hard With New Cosmetics Line,\" HollywoodLife announces in a purported \"exclusive.\" It says in the accompanying story, \"Uh oh! Workaholic Kanye West has grand plans to launch a new cosmetics line, but it has wife Kim Kardashian terrified he's stretching himself too thin.\"  The site asserts, \"Coming just a few months after his breakdown that led to an eight-day psychiatric hospitalization, his wife Kim Kardashian is scared about what taking on all this extra work could do to his mental healing.\" A so-called \"source\" is quoted as telling the webloid, \"Kanye's grand plans for business have Kim worried for Kanye's health. Things have been good between Kim and Kanye lately and she admires his ambition, but his latest venture in cosmetics has Kim worried for her husband's health.\"  Yes, that repetitious quote sounds entirely natural. This (quite possibly fictional) \"source\" continues, \"She does not want Kanye over-worked or stressed over business deals or involved in anything that could affect his sensitive health situation.\" Adds the (quite possibly invented) tipster, \"Kim wants Kanye to spend more time with her and the children and less time starting new businesses.\"  Here's what's going on: TMZ recently reported that West wanted to trademark \"Donda,\" his late mother's name, for a cosmetics line. Hours later, HollywoodLies magically managed to have \"exclusive\" information all about it, including Kardashian's supposed reaction to his plans. But Gossip Cop has repeatedly been told that the disreputable outlet doesn't have real sources when it comes to the couple.  In fact, after HollywoodLife made up stories about Kardashian's robbery, we learned that the weloid doesn't even bother to fact-check its \"exclusives\" with the reality star's camp, instead choosing to publish unverified \"fabrication[s].\" And that appears to be what's happened here. A rep for Kardashian exclusively tells Gossip Cop the allegation she's upset with West is \"false.\"",
        "  Kylie Jenner attends the 2015 Billboard Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet \u2014 Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.  For some celebrities, this would not be a big deal \u2014 some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as \u201csources\u201d and \u201cinsiders\u201d dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.  After all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.  So the decision to keep Kylie\u2019s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.  The non-confirmation of the news \u2014 reported by the tabloids in September and described as a \u201chappy\u201d surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott \u2014 has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family\u2019s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie\u2019s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.  [Kylie Jenner still hasn\u2019t confirmed her pregnancy. On Christmas, fans melted down on social media.]  Meanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie\u2019s first public appearance since the fall, although she\u2019s wearing baggy clothes.

According to Naughty Gossip reports:  \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,\u201d sources tell Straight Shuter. \u201cYou can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.\u201d  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyonc\u00e9 is private. THAT doesn\u2019t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though \u2013 something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don\u2019t really see her doing a silent birth.

        "Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .) Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, \"I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!\" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. \"It's just so special with Bindi,\" he told reporters backstage. \"She's a champion of life.\" Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks \"to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!\" The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. \"There's not a thing I would change about this season,\" he told Glamour post-show. \"There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible.\" While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. \"I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps.\" Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. \"Bindi was the whole package,\" praised the red-haired stunner. \"She and Derek had a beautiful partnership.\" Still, \"it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that.\" Echoed Nick: \"It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me.\" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed. As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: \"I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot.\" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? \"It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately.\" Added Lindsay: \"I'll be his wing woman on tour!\" During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. \"I feel incredible!\" gushed the pro. \"Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!\" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, \"which is our anniversary too.\" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter! In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the nerves don't get the best of her. \"I heard you have to brine it, but I don't even know what that means!\" she laughed. \"I'm watching The Chew to learn techniques!\" One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. \"I can't wait,\" admitted Mark Ballas . \"I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat.\" Allison Holker felt the same way: \"I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne.\" Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant. \"She would be great, but you know [the producers] would probably mess with us and give her to Derek!\" Mark joked. So what was B.C.'s take on this idea? \"Yeah, and we'd probably win,\" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother. Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called \"the love of my life\") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. \"It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that. To be able to perform with the love of my life and in front of my brother for life and the beautiful Bindi",

She is the youngest daughter of singer and songwriter Lionel Richie and adoptive sister to fashion designer and television personality Nicole Richie.  Early life [ edit ]  Sofia Richie was born in Los Angeles, California to parents Lionel Richie and his second wife Diane Alexander. She is the younger sister of Nicole Richie (who was adopted) and the biological sister of Miles Richie.[1] Sofia Richie's godfather was Michael Jackson. She reported that the visits to Jackson's Neverland Ranch were some of her favorite memories as a child, and she became close friends with his daughter, Paris.[2]  Richie grew up with an affinity for music like her father. She learned to sing at age 5 and to play the piano at age 7.[3] She made occasional appearances at her father's shows[2] and took vocal lessons from Beyonce's vocal coach, Tim Carter, when she was 14, as well.[3] She also worked in the studio with her brother-in-law (and Good Charlotte lead vocalist) Joel Madden.[4][3] She decided to move away from a music career, however, because of the pressure of living up to her father's stature in the music industry.[5]  Richie spent some time at Oaks Christian School\u2014nicknamed \"Celebrity High\"\u2014before being educated at home for several years while her father was on tour. She played soccer until age 16 when she broke her hip in a Segway accident.[5]  Modeling career [ edit ]  Richie began modeling at age 14 with a feature in Teen Vogue[4] and at 15 she got her first fashion contract with Los Angeles-based swimwear company Mary Grace Swim.[6] The next year, Richie signed with London-based modeling agency Select Model Management.[7]  Richie has featured in advertising campaigns for a number of brands including DL1961,[8] Madonna's Material Girl line,[2] Chanel,[9] Dolce & Gabbana,[9] Adidas, Michael Kors,[11] and Tommy Hilfiger.[9] She has done photoshoots for Elle and Vanity Fair[5] and has recently appeared on the cover of Complex[5] and Billboard magazine's style issue.[3]",
        "The actress and her business partner, Saundra Pelletier, sat down with Elaine Welteroth to talk about their new sex-positive digital resource center, Tryst Network, at the 2018 MAKERS Conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Feb. 6.",
        "The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine\u2019s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We\u2019re in Stanley\u2019s on St Andrew\u2019s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It\u2019s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of \u201cLet\u2019s go out, but not to our usual place\u201d. I\u2019ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don\u2019t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley\u2019s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn\u2019t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we\u2019re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There\u2019s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we\u2019re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we\u2019ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley\u2019s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She\u2019s the sommelier here. But don\u2019t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We\u2019re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is \u201camazing\u201d, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a \u20ac16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at \u20ac13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There\u2019s a small farmyard on that \u20ac16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the \u201cbacon and cabbage\u201d, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn\u2019t enough on the plate (there is), we\u2019ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas \u2013 but that\u2019s even better in my book \u2013 and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It\u2019s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There\u2019s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that\u2019s served deliciously chilly. It\u2019s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we\u2019ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that\u2019s what Stanley\u2019s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries a",

The pair weren\u2019t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. \u00a9 Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez\u2019s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt \u201ctied down\u201d in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we\u2019re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a \u201clove triangle\u201d with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn\u2019t caused by the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d singer.

        "Megyn Marie Kelly (born November 18, 1970)[4][5] is an American journalist, political commentator, and former corporate defense attorney. She is the host of her live-audience, morning show NBC Megyn Kelly Today. She was a news anchor at Fox News from 2004 to 2017, and is currently with NBC News. On January 3, 2017, Kelly announced her departure from Fox News and stated that she would be joining NBC News. On June 4, 2017, she started hosting a Sunday night news magazine program titled Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.[6] From October 2013 to January 2017, during her career at Fox News, Kelly hosted The Kelly File. She previously hosted America Live, and prior to that, co-hosted America's Newsroom with Bill Hemmer. From 2007 to 2012, the two reporters hosted Fox News Channel's New Year's Eve specials, \"All American New Year\". She was included in the 2014 Time list of the 100 most influential people.[7] Early life [ edit ] Kelly was born in Champaign, Illinois,[8] to Edward Kelly, who taught at the State University of New York at Albany, and Linda (n\u00e9e DeMaio), a homemaker.[9] She is of Italian and German descent on her mother's side and Irish descent on her father's.[9] Kelly's father died of a heart attack when she was 15 years old.[10] Kelly was raised Roman Catholic.[11] Kelly attended Tecumseh Elementary School in DeWitt, New York. When she was 9, her family moved to the Albany, New York, suburb[12] of Delmar, where she attended Bethlehem Central High School.[13] She obtained an undergraduate degree in political science from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1992[9] and earned a J.D. from Albany Law School in 1995.[14] Kelly was an associate in the Chicago office of law firm Bickel & Brewer LLP, during which time she co-wrote an article for the American Bar Association's journal, Litigation, called \"The Conflicting Roles of Lawyer as Director\".[15] She later joined Jones Day for nine years, where one of her clients was the credit bureau Experian.[16] Television career [ edit ] Early career [ edit ] In 2003, Kelly moved to Washington, D.C., where she was hired by the ABC affiliate WJLA-TV as a general assignment reporter.[10] While there, she covered significant national and local events, including live coverage of the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. and Chief Justice John G. Roberts; the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist; and the 2004 presidential election.[17] After working as a journalist for WJLA, Kelly then applied for a job at Fox News in 2004.[17] CNN president Jonathan Klein would later regret not hiring Kelly as a reporter at the beginning of her career, as she was \"the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else\".[18] Fox News [ edit ] Kelly contributed legal segments for Special Report with Brit Hume and hosted her own legal segment, Kelly's Court, during Weekend Live. She appeared on a weekly segment on The O'Reilly Factor and occasionally filled in for Greta Van Susteren on On the Record, where most of her reporting focused on legal and political matters. She occasionally contributed as an anchor, but more often as a substitute anchor on weekends.[19] On February 1, 2010, Kelly began hosting her own two-hour afternoon show, America Live, replacing Fox News' previous show The Live Desk.[20][21] She has been a guest-panelist on Fox News' late-night satire program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. In 2010, viewership for America Live increased by 20%, averaging 1,293,000 viewers, and increased by 4% in the 25\u201354 age demographic, averaging 268,000 viewers.[22] In December 2010, Kelly was confirmed to be hosting a New Year's Eve special with Bill Hemmer.[23] Kelly received media attention for her coverage of the results of the 2012 United States presidential election. On November 6, 2012 (the night of the election), Fox News' decision desk projected that Obama would win a second term after part of the results had been released. In response to Karl Rove's opposition to this projection, Kelly walked backstage to the decision desk on camera and spoke with them, and also asked Rove, \"Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?\"[24][25][26][27] Kelly left as host of America Live in the beginning of July 2013 for maternity leave and returned to host a new nightly program The Kelly File on October 7, 2013.[28][29] Over the years, The Kelly File has at different times overtaken the channel's regular number one The O'Reilly Factor in ratings.[30][31] However, The Kelly File has also been overtaken by Hannity.[32] In December 2013, remarks made by Kelly in reaction to a Slate article drew controversy. On The Kelly File, she said, \"For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa,\" adding, \"But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it.\" Kelly also stated that Jesus was a white man later in the segment.[33] Soon after, Jon Stewart,[34] Stephen Colbert,[35] Rachel Maddow,[36] Josh Barro,[37] and others satirized her remarks.[38] Two days later, she made additional on-air statements, characterizing her original comments as \"tongue-in-cheek\",[39][40][41][42][43] and that the skin color of Jesus is \"far from settled\".[44] In June 2015, Kelly interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. She later interviewed two of their daughters, Jill and Jessa. This show's Nielsen national estimates ratings of 3.09 million viewers, above its average 2.11 million, ranked with the 3.2 million for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 coverage and 7.3 million for the Ferguson riots coverage.[45] In the Republican Party presidential debate on August 6, 2015, Kelly asked whether a man of Trump's temperament ought to be elected president.[46] Kelly's moderating generated a range of media and political",
        "\u201cI just got wasted the whole time,\u201d he revealed during an interview with The Times. \u201cYou feel insane, but I think the studio cut my days because I started speaking total gibberish. Became a total liability.\u201d  But now, according to a source, Robert is back on the straight and narrow, thanks to his fianc\u00e9 FKA Twigs.  The insider tells OK! \u201cRob was basically a 24-hour pot smoker back in his Twilight days, but since his relationship with Twigs got serious he's scaled back on all his vices and hardly ever drinks or smokes around other people.\u201d  If Robert drank due to being stressed with the fame of Twilight, we can only imagine what happened after those infamous photos of Kristen Stewart making out with her movie producer boss while they were still together did to him.  \"He's matured a lot and become this very serious young man,\u201d adds the source. \u201cRob\u2019s dismayed that Charlie [Hunnam] hasn\u2019t given up his pot habit. He doesn\u2019t want to hang out with him, or his other hard-partying friends like Tom Sturridge or Eddie Redmayne.\u201d  But we haven\u2019t heard anything negative about FKA Twigs since they started dating in 2014, so it sounds like having a low-profile and more mature partner is exactly what he needed to turn his life around!",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle\u2019s childhood best friend has revealed the real reason her first marriage broke up - and it wasn't a mutual decision.  Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fianc\u00e9e, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  \"The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,\" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,\" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  \"Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There\u2019s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood\u2019s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls\u2019 high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.  (Image: Instagram)  Elsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.

She used to practise announcing herself.\"  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  \"I think it\u2019s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  \"I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana\u2019s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.\"  She added: \"I wasn\u2019t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries \u2014 films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.\"",

        "Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline? So. Much. Drama. Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we\u2019re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that\u2019s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions. The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive. Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we\u2019ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there\u2019s a lot to dive into. photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010.

However, it\u2019s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren\u2019t true. photography via pinterest November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin Don\u2019t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there\u2019s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria\u2019s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber. photography via instagram.com/ashilrd January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber They clearly can\u2019t stay away from one another for long.

However, it\u2019s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they\u2019ve since broken up. photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans. Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing \u201cLet Me Love You\u201d So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake\u2019s \u201cLet Me Love You,\u201d which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it\u2019s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez\u2019s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it\u2019s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex\u2019s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena! photography via instagram.com/revivaltour November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic.

        "Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn\u2019t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d boyfriend they needed to break up.  \u201cJamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,\u201d a source told RadarOnline. \u201cKatie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie\u2019s behavior. She knew it wasn\u2019t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.\u201d  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri\u2019s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn\u2019t see her.  \u201cTom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn\u2019t see Suri, he didn\u2019t question it,\u201d an insider told the Star. \u201cBut Tom\u2019s tired of being bossed around by them. He\u2019s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he\u2019s missed out on so much. He\u2019s dying to be a part of her life!\u201d  Holmes isn\u2019t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to \u201cbrainwash\u201d her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what\u2019s best for Suri.  \u201cShe\u2019s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,\u201d an insider told the Star. \u201cSuri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what\u2019s best for her. Tom has assured her he won\u2019t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.\u201d  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes\u2019 publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  \u201cThe Radar story is 100 percent untrue,\u201d Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes\u2019 publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. T",

        "Two arrests have been made in the murders of four women at Fairmont Terrace Apartments last month, police announced Wednesday afternoon.  Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a \"lick\" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    \"The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.\"",

        "The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (\u00a323,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich \u2014 and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding\u2014 the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (\u00a323.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (\u00a332 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel \u2014 and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place \u2014 is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (\u00a330 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.",
        "Chris Soules, former star of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP) Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer. Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The case has garnered the attention of Soules\u2019s \u201cBachelor\u201d fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star\u2019s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate. \u201cThis story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,\u201d Mary Jo Brown, Arlington\u2019s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. \u201cSometimes fame isn\u2019t your friend.\u201d Soules, who also appeared in \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and \u201cWorst Chefs in America,\u201d called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home. The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said. The tractor driver \u2014 later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran \u2014 was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said. Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher\u2019s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure. The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way. \u201cCan I, can I call you back really quick?\u201d Soules asked the dispatcher. \u201cYeah, you can call me back,\u201d she says. \u201cThank you,\u201d Soules responds. Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff\u2019s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules \u201ctook off\u201d in a red truck. Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said. Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash. Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor. During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He \u201cwould not come out,\u201d the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which \u201ctook hours.\u201d Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR \u2014 Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017 Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were \u201crunning into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information\u201d but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights. According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register. The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed. Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation. A statement from Soules\u2019s publicist earlier this week said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d were with the man\u2019s family. Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora \u2014 population 200 \u2014 lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher\u2019s obituary. An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association. \u201cKenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,\u201d Mosher\u2019s obituary said. \u201cHis family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.\u201d In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men. Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff during the finale of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d (ABC via AP) Soules\u2019s three sisters signed him up to be a suitor on \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d in 2014. He was a fan favorite, making it to the final three before bachelorette Andi Dorfman sent him home. Soules \u2014 nicknamed \u201cFarmer Chris\u201d \u2014 later returned as the star of his own season. He proposed to Whitney Bischoff, a contestant from Chicago, but the two split after a brief engagement. He later competed on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and the Food Network\u2019s \u201cWorst Chefs in America.\u201d Soules has since made guest appearances on various \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise spin-offs shows and was rumored to be a cast member for this summer\u2019s taping of \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d where former contestants search for love on",

NBC has been a leader for diversity in broadcasting, but recent reports that Hall and Roker will be replaced by former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly are being seen by industry professionals as whitewashing.\"  On Thursday, an NBC spokesperson issued a response. \"NBC News has a long and proven history as an industry leader in newsroom diversity,\" the statement reads. \"We will continue to engage in the running dialogue we\u2019ve had for many years with the National Association of Black Journalists and other advocacy groups to advance those goals.\"  Earlier this week, NBC announced that Hall, 46, was leaving NBC and MSNBC.

Although the arrival of their twins has left the celebrity duo feeling \"totally exhausted\", Beyonce and Jay are both still overjoyed.  A source said: \"At nights, Beyonce has been overwhelmed with all the work needed caring for two babies. Despite all the help they are receiving, Jay is still pitching it so that Beyonce has total support.  \"Neither Beyonce, nor Jay, have been able to enjoy an entire night of sleep since the twins arrived.

        "Caitlyn Jenner is having weird sense of joy these days! Says Cellulite makes her feel more feminine!  Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood. She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her different sense of joy and can\u2019t wait to show it off.  A weird article  The headline \u201cCellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!\u201d from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this! It said:  Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can\u2019t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!  That seems really weird, doesn\u2019t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path. She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a \u201cblabbermouth\u201d. And I don\u2019t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense. Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let\u2019s see what the article had to say other than that. It said:  She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn\u2019t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!  Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can\u2019t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh. It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can\u2019t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her. It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality everyday. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body. It also said that Jenner\u2019s view: \u201cdimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.\u201d and it was also reported that she wouldn\u2019t mind having more cellulite in her body in future. The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner\u2019s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, the 67 year old Jenner might not want to do it anymore. \u201cSo let it be!\u201d is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason maybe her daughter Kim\u2019s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.  Rumors or truth  This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, a issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner \u201cwants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.\u201d Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret \u2018cyber hookups\u2019. The transgender star, Jenner has had gender reassignment surgery as well as she said she was never interested in men. There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.  Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is a decathlete turned TV personality. She is known by her previous name \u201cBruce Jenner\u201d. The Olympic gold medal winner came out as a transgender in April 2015. She is the celebrity from the reality show \u201cKeeping Up with Kardashians\u201d along with her daughters. She has undergone a knee surgery before which she was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets. More Bio\u2026",
        "  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor \u2014 and two-time People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive cover model \u2014 George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life \u2014 actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, \u201cI don\u2019t see myself ever having kids.\u201d  But it was a long road to get there. \u201cI don\u2019t have that gene that people have to replicate,\u201d he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn\u2019t married with kids, he replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t had aspirations in that way, ever.\u201d And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? \u201cWhat do you do? Should I go, \u2018I got to get me some kids right now!\u2019 and rush out and impregnate someone?\u201d  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: \u201cWell, I\u2019m also not running for president, but I played that role in \u2018Ides of March.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t an actual lawyer when I did \u2018Michael Clayton,\u2019 and I don\u2019t fire people for a living like I did in \u2018Up in the Air.\u2019 \u201d  \u201cI keep saying I\u2019ll never get married again or have children but people just don\u2019t want to believe me,\u201d Clooney told Britain\u2019s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it\u2019s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  \u201cElla, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,\u201d the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. \u201cGeorge is sedated and should recover in a few days.\u201d",
        "Lisa Rinna made her feelings quite clear when she zealously came to her husband Harry Hamlin's defense on Tuesday's episode of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills after Kim Richards accused him of harboring a secret. And now the 63-year-old Mad Men actor is applauding his wife's actions. The LA Law star said that he and Lisa equally defend each other's honor. Scroll down for video Happy couple: Harry Hamlin stood behind his wife Lisa Rinna after her outburst on Tuesday's Real Housewives of Beverly Hills defending his honor. The pair are pictured at an awards dinner in LA in February 'I was actually proud of her. I mean, look -- you are getting your back up against a wall with something like that,' he told US Weekly at the Raising The Bar to End Parkinson\u2019s event in Sherman Oaks, California on Saturday. 'What do you expect you know in the long run? But every time I see it, I go, \"You go girl!'\" Even though he previously had his reservations about his wife coming on the show, Harry now admits Lisa is doing a good job. Make-believe: TMZ has reported that Kim Richards invented the fact that she knows a secret about Harry that Lisa is covering up during last week's episode 'Well, you know, I am [proud] because she\u2019s doing a magnificent job,' he said. 'I think she\u2019s bringing some class to a show that is kind of a reflection of who we are today. 'So in some sense it is art in that respect. I think she\u2019s doing an extraordinary job.' As for the big secret Kim is accusing him of hiding? Harry said he is in the dark just like everyone else. Losing her cool: When Kim, 50, brought up her husband, Lisa, 51, furiously smashed a glass of wine 'There is a hashtag #WhatDidHarryDo? out there so maybe someone will tell me at some point, and I hope it was good,' he joked. On last week's episode, Kim, 50, accused Lisa of harboring a secret about her husband, causing Lisa, 51, to throw and smash a glass full of wine. Fans were left wondering exactly what Kim 'knew' about Harry, 63, but TMZ reports that Kim fabricated the story just to push Lisa\u2019s buttons. In the face: Lisa tossed a glass full of wine into Kim's face According to production sources, the Housewives brought up the issue again during the taping of the reunion episode, and Kim admitted she made it up. The season five reunion episode was filmed on February 20 and will air on a later date. Fans witnessed the feud between Kim and Lisa come to a dramatic head on Tuesday night's episode. In a final flourish after a menacing exchange of words, Lisa furiously smashed a wine glass after throwing the contents in Kim's face. 'I f***ing lost my f***ing marbles,' Lisa admitted later. The astonishing fight came during what should have been a civilized dinner during a trip to Yolanda Foster's hometown of Amsterdam. Drama: The astonishing fight came during what should have been a civilized dinner during a trip to Yolanda Foster's hometown of Amsterdam But the civility did not last long as they started having a serious chat, with Lisa discussing her 'really deep-rooted issues about people dying from alcohol and drug overdoses' after losing her 21-year-old sister when she was just six. Breaking down, Lisa turned to Kim and said: 'I'm sorry if I've ever gotten into any of your business, I never meant to \u2026' 'Well, you have,' Kim snapped, shocking everyone by cutting her short in her emotional moment and bringing up their feud on the jet over there. About to explode: Lisa became outraged after Kim brought up her husband Harry 'I have been sober for three years,' Kim insisted, adding that her one time taking a pill at the poker party was a one off. 'You have gone around to everybody and talked about me,' she said, also pointing to Eileen and saying: 'And you too. She then unexpectedly turned the tables on Lisa, telling her: 'I'm concerned about you, and your situation at home. You wanna bring out my stuff, let's talk about your home life.' Dinner fight: Kim's sister Kyle Richards looked downcast as the fight dragged on As Eileen angrily intervened - telling her 'shame on you' - Kim snapped: 'Shut your f***ing mouth, I've had enough of you you beast.' As Yolanda tried to calm everyone down, she mentioned about how Lisa was understanding because she has admitted that her husband Harry has only been sober for three years. 'Let's talk about the husband,' Kim said spitefully. 'Let's not talk about what you don't want out.' Too much drama: Kyle, 46, became upset after watching sister Kim's outburst and its aftermath That was when Lisa exploded, initially trying to grab Kim's face as she snapped: 'Let me tell you something - don't touch my husband, ever.' 'If you don't want it out for everybody to know, you better watch what you talk about me, or everybody will know,' Kim replied. 'Everybody will know.' Lisa then stood up, threw the contents of her glass at Kim and then angrily smashed it on the table's edge, screaming as Yolanda held her back: 'You never go near my husband! Don't you f***ing understand that? You never go after my f***ing husband!' Reflecting on her behaviour: 'I f***ing lost my f***ing marbles,' Lisa admitted later Later, she asked: 'What the f*** does Kim Richards know - what does she know about Harry? What did he do? She doesn't even know my husband.' Kim's hatred did not extend just to Lisa and Eileen, 55, - she also attacked her sister Kyle, snidely saying 'go after your new friend' as Kyle, 46, prepared to leave in tears. 'You want me to defend you but your behavior is indefensible!' she sobbed. Making up: Kim surprised Lisa the next morning by coming to her room to talk things",
        "A tearful Kimmel told the audience, \u201cHere we are again, in the aftermath of another terrible, inexplicably shocking and painful tragedy, this time in Las Vegas, which happens to be my home town.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe pray for the victims, and for their families and friends and we wonder why, even though there\u2019s probably no way to ever know why a human being would do something like this to other human beings at a concert who are having fun and listening to music.\u201d  Celebrities are reacting to Jimmy Kimmel \u2019s powerful monologue on the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 500. The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d See stars\u2019 reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading comments from people who say \u2018This is terrible, but there\u2019s nothing we could do about it.\u2019 I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don\u2019t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there\u2019s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.\u201d  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, \u201cThey should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.\u201d  Among those commenting on the late night host\u2019s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who said, \u201cJimmy Kimmel is an American hero \u2013 [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.\u201d Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, \u201cA powerful call to action. Thank you, @jimmykimmel.\u201d Will Arnett tweeted, \u201c@jimmykimmel says what needs to be said.\u201d And Alyssa Milano, who shared the link to Kimmel\u2019s monologue on her Twitter account, expressed, \u201cGood morning! Please watch. Please share.\u201d Gossip Cop will continue to update as more celebrities react to Kimmel\u2019s comments on the Las Vegas shooting. Watch the video above.",
        "Ellen DeGeneres has all the feels! On Thursday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the daytime talk show host continues to celebrate her 60th birthday by having wife Portia de Rossi on the program. Seated next to Ellen, the 45-year-old actress proceeds to bring her wife of nine years to tears upon presenting her with the \"best\" gift. \"It's your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,\" Portia explains. \"Not just now, but what you've always cared about. What you were influenced by and what has made you the amazing person that you are today. So, I combined that and questions when we first met like, 'Who's your idol? And what would you do if you weren't a talk show host?'\" She continues, \"So, I combined that with the fact that literally guys, for, like, the last two years, Ellen has said to me, 'I feel like I'm not doing enough.' Every day, almost. So, I put all that together and I got you this gift. So, let's see it -- happy birthday!\" Portia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. \"So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,\" she reveals. \"Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!\" Portia didn't stop there! \"I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,\" she shares. \"So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do.\" Blown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, \"It\u2019s the best gift. I\u2019ve always said -- and when we got married, Portia\u2019s line was, 'It\u2019s good to be loved; it\u2019s profound to be understood' -- and, she understands me because that is the best gift that anybody could have given me.

        "More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor\u2019s shocking dismissal.  \u201cThe whole thing has been very painful for me,\u201d Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. \u201cThe accounts I\u2019ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it\u2019s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  \u201cI had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It\u2019s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.\u201d  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer \u201cpinches me on the ass a lot.\u201d A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer\u2019s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC\u2019s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a \u201cdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d with reason to believe \u201cthis may not have been an isolated incident.\u201d Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  \u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d he said, in part. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\u201d  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer\u2019s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I\u2019m ready to. Thanks for your interest.\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time\u2019s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men \u2014 including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp \u2014 have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time\u2019s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time\u2019s Up was a major focus at this year\u2019s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  \u201cI think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,\u201d Couric tells PEOPLE about Time\u2019s Up. \u201cClearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.\u201d  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  \u201cOne of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,\u201d she says. \u201cI just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and ",
        "Robert Pattinson is raising some questions in the romance department.  The actor, 31, made headlines late last month after he said he's only \"kind of\" engaged to FKA twigs during an interview with Howard Stern. Fast forward to this weekend when he was spotted getting cozy with good pal Katy Perry during a dinner outing Saturday night, causing lots of fans to question what's really going on.  Well, E! News has learned things might be heating up between Pattinson and Perry as he's already allegedly cooled off from FKA twigs, who he started dating in 2014 and proposed to the following year.  \"He is technically still with FKA twigs, but it doesn't seem like it will last,\" one source told us. \"They were serious at one point, but not anymore. The whole thing with Rob saying they are 'kind of engaged' speaks for itself. The relationship has been fizzling out.\"",

The first appears to show a woman and Kevin in a club getting cozy. The tape then cuts to a bed, where you don't see the people in the bed ... but hear creaking and what could be people having sex.

        "\u201cA Star Is Born\u201d is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie. It\u2019s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own \u2014 rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It\u2019s set in the present day, but in spirit it\u2019s a sophisticated retro \u201970s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie\u2019s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol\u2019-boy redneck rock \u2018n\u2019 roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he\u2019s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere. She takes off as he slowly crashes \u2014 that\u2019s the soapy tragic \u201cStar Is Born\u201d concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that\u2019s shorn of the usual \u201cbeats.\u201d The new \u201cStar Is Born\u201d is a total emotional knockout, but it\u2019s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it\u2019s telling. More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn\u2019t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like \u201cVictim of Love\u201d-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That\u2019s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll movie since \u201cAlmost Famous.\u201d And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look \u2014 the beard and rancher\u2019s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle \u2014 mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock \u2018n\u2019 roll strutted its \u201cauthenticity,\u201d but now that he\u2019s out of date, Jackson\u2019s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It\u2019s a part he\u2019s playing, an image he\u2019s working \u2014 and secretly struggling \u2014 to keep alive. He\u2019s got a signature ballad that goes \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to let the old ways die,\u201d and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn\u2019t know that he was talking about himself. In the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he\u2019s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It\u2019s what he believes in more than the show he\u2019s just finished. How do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to \u201cplay drunk,\u201d but Cooper doesn\u2019t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it\u2019s powerful). He brings off something I\u2019ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl \u2014 a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it\u2019s marinated in. Needing another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It\u2019s not his scene, but he doesn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he\u2019s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage. She is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she\u2019s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We\u2019ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of \u201cLa Vie en Rose\u201d that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, \u201cOf course! How Gaga-netic!\u201d Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally\u2019s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink. But when she emerges from the dressing room",
        "Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn\u2019t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn\u2019t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she\u2019s doing just fine. She\u2019s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an \u201cindustry creative,\u201d whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there\u2019s no reason to believe we\u2019ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she\u2019s in love or having babies.  \u201cFor the record, I am not pregnant,\u201d she wrote then. \u201cWhat I am is fed up. I\u2019m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of \u2018journalism,\u2019 the \u2018First Amendment,\u2019 and \u2018celebrity news.\u2019\u201d  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy.

        "Emily Olivia Leah Blunt (born 23 February 1983)[3] is a British-American actress.[4] She is the recipient of several accolades, including one Golden Globe Award and has been nominated for two competitive British Academy Film Awards. Educated in the performing arts at the Hurtwood House in Dorking, Blunt made her acting debut in a 2001 stage production of The Royal Family. She went on to appear in the television film Boudica and portrayed the ill-fated queen consort Catherine Howard in the miniseries Henry VIII (both 2003), following which she made her feature film debut in the 2004 drama My Summer of Love. Blunt's breakthrough came in 2006 when she starred in the television film Gideon's Daughter and the highly successful American comedy film The Devil Wears Prada. The former won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and the latter earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Blunt's profile continued to expand as she took on leading roles in the period film The Young Victoria (2009), the romantic comedy Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011), the science fiction films The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Looper (2012), and Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and the musical fantasy Into the Woods (2014). She was praised for playing a principled FBI agent in the crime film Sicario (2015) and an alcoholic woman in the thriller The Girl on the Train (2016); for the latter she received nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. In 2018, Blunt starred alongside her husband, John Krasinski, in the acclaimed horror film A Quiet Place, and will next star as Mary Poppins in the musical fantasy film Mary Poppins Returns. Early life [ edit ] Blunt was born in Wandsworth, London.[5][6] She is the second of four children[7] born to Joanna, a former actress and teacher,[8][9] and barrister Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, QC.[10][11][12] Her siblings are Felicity, Sebastian, and Susannah.[10][13] Her grandfather was Major-General Peter Blunt, and one of her paternal uncles is Crispin Blunt,[14] Conservative Member of Parliament for Reigate. From the age of seven to 14, Blunt struggled with stuttering.[15] She credits a school teacher for helping her overcome the stutter through acting.[16] She went on to sit on the board of directors for the American Institute for Stuttering.[17] Blunt attended Ibstock Place School in Roehampton, southwest London and, at the age of 16, went to Hurtwood House in Dorking, Surrey, a private sixth-form college known for its performing arts programme. There, she was discovered and signed by an agent.[18][not in citation given] Career [ edit ] 2001\u20132004: Career beginnings [ edit ] In November 2001, Blunt made her professional debut opposite Dame Judi Dench in Sir Peter Hall's production of the play The Royal Family, in which she played the role of the granddaughter Gwen to Dench's Fanny Cavendish. Critic Tom Keatinge hailed the production, writing that \"Peter Hall's direction and Anthony Ward's tremendous set combine with all this to make The Royal Family a terrific night's entertainment\", and that \"it provides a vehicle for acting of the finest quality, with strong performances from the whole ensemble\".[19] For her performance, Blunt was named \"Best Newcomer\" by the Evening Standard. She went on to perform as Eugenie in Nicholas Wright's Vincent in Brixton at the National Theatre, and as Juliet in Indhu Rubasingham's production of Romeo and Juliet at Chichester Festival Theatre, both in 2002.[18] In 2003, Blunt made her screen debut in the British television drama Boudica, about the life of the ancient Celtic warrior-queen who fought the Romans. That same year, she was praised for her performance as the 16th-century queen Catherine Howard in the two-part British television drama Henry VIII.[18] In 2004, Blunt received considerable attention for her performance as Tamsin in the independent British drama My Summer of Love, a love story revolving around two young women from different social and economic backgrounds in the English countryside.[18] Director Pawel Pawlikowski gave high praise to Blunt and co-star Natalie Press, stating in an interview that \"Both Natalie and Emily were extremely different and very original, which is a rare thing nowadays. They avoid the obvious, and are capable of playing complex and conflicting attitudes. Above all, they had energy, which is key for a movie.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film, calling it a \"gem\" lost in the \"hype\" of Hollywood blockbusters, and noted that \"Both Natalie Press and Emily Blunt [...] are superlative. They nail their cinematic alter-egos effortlessly, using verbal and non-verbal cues to tap into their emotions. They understand their characters and use their talents to bring them to life.\"[20] She shared the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer with Press.[21] 2005\u20132010: The Devil Wears Prada and breakthrough [ edit ] Blunt starred opposite Bill Nighy and Miranda Richardson in the British television drama Gideon's Daughter,[18] based on an original screenplay written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, where she played the troubled only child of New Labour spin doctor Gideon Warner, played by Nighy. The film premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival in 2005, and debuted on British television in February 2006. Praised for its \"sterling performances,\"[22] Blunt won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her performance.[23] She then featured opposite Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway in the comedy The Devil Wears Prada, set in the fashion world in New York City. Blunt played Emily, the senior assistant of Runway magazine editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly, played by Streep. Blunt and Hathaway were required to maintain a strict diet regimen for their roles, so much so that Hathaway later revealed that it made them cry.[24] The film was a commercial and critical success, grossing $326,551,094.[25] Though Streep garnered most of the attention for her role, Blunt's performance was equally praised, with Clifford Pugh of The Houston Chronicle asserting that",
        "Despite rumors of a split, Rihanna is still very much together with boyfriend of one year Hassan Jameel. We\u2019ve got the pics of their steamy Mexican getaway  Rihanna has kept her one year romance with Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel super private. So when rumors surfaced in June that they had broken up fans were waiting to see proof they were still a couple. They got it on July 9 when pics surfaced of the 30-year-old singer and the businessman on a sexy Mexican getaway. The two appeared to be locked in a animated conversation as bikini clad RiRi is seen pointing her right index finger in the air with her mouth open, looking like she had something important to say. In another pic Hassan is seen looking back at her with his hand on his chest as if they\u2019re involved in a somewhat heated conversation. CLICK HERE to see all the pics.  On June 1 MediaTakeOut claimed RiRi had dumped Hassan. The site reported that \u201cRihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes,\u201d an alleged insider told them. They said that the handsome billionaire wasn\u2019t doing too well after the split. \u201cOf course Rihanna broke his heart. That\u2019s what she does \u2014 break men\u2019s hearts.\u201d Since Rihanna has never commented on her romance with Hassan and goes to great lengths to keep their relationship away from the public eye, MTO\u2019s report spread like wildfire.  Obviously something is still on between Rihanna and Hassan, as they are having a hot summer together. They were first photographed a year ago making out in a pool in Spain. They\u2019ve only been pictured a handful of times since, keeping their love undercover. The \u201cWork\u201d singer\u2019s previous relationship was with Drake, 31, and it played out in public. He even professed his years of love to her in front of the world while presenting her with the Video Vanguard award at the 2016 VMAs. After having the public know all about their dating business, Ri has wisely kept her romance with Hassan as far out of the public eye as possible.  Rihanna revealed recently that Drake gushing about her on live TV made her cringe. In a May 2018 interview with Vogue, she said \u201cWaiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don\u2019t like too many compliments; I don\u2019t like to be put on blast.\u201d As for where she stands with Drizzy, she told the mag that they haven\u2019t spoken and that \u201cWe don\u2019t have a friendship now, but we\u2019re not enemies either. It is what it is.\u201d However she did come the close to discussing her relationship with Hassan, telling the publication that she dating and she is happy. \u201cI used to feel guilty about taking personal time,\u201d she revealed, \u201cbut I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,\u201d she said about her romance with Hassan.",

If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.  He would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends.

        "MAY 02, 2017  RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  Stay informed on the latest rare disease news and developments by signing up for our newsletter  In this week\u2019s Hollywood gossip, it was revealed that Brad Pitt does not have a rare disease that is \u2018eating him away.\u2019Whew.However, the actor is no stranger to the rare disease community. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease \u2013 prosopagnosia \u2014 also known as face blindness. According to the article, \"Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls \"a real conversation,\" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.\"It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.",
        "Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, \u201cJen To Justin: I\u2019ll Raise Our Baby Alone!\u201d followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband.

But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn\u2019t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband.

        "Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled \"Spring Breaks: Part 1\", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in \"200 Cigarettes\", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in \"Gossip\" and \"Dr T and the Women\" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.",
        "Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise\u2019s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he\u2019s still struggling to salvage what\u2019s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer\u2019s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, \u201cRachel and Daniel haven\u2019t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.\u201d The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in \u2018554 days\u2019.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple\u2019s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York\u2019s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, \u201cThe whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don\u2019t buy it for a minute.\u201d  When you consider Daniel Craig\u2019s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, \u201cBeing on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don\u2019t trust myself. I need that balance.\u201d If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now \u2013 all of a sudden \u2013 he\u2019s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he\u2019s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories \u2013 and how they\u2019ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat \u2013 one wouldn\u2019t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel\u2019s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he\u2019s giving up on his marriage?

        "Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.  People are always saying unflattering things about you.  Even if you're the Pope.  The only time it can affect you, however, is when you hear about it.  Or, worse, if someone makes the unpleasant comment directly to you.  Which brings us, quite naturally, to Twitter.  Here's a place that's just too perfect for the nasty, uncontrolled insult.  You can hide behind your egg and toss Bons-Molotovs at anyone you choose.  Some people choose Kim Kardashian.  She's an easy target.  Her life seems effortless. She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.  Hers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.  Small wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.

You can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.  You can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.  You can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.  Or, you can be splendidly disarming.  This last path was the one taken by Kardashian.  No it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018  Not everyone can pull this off with a straight face.  But here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.  His biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.  So she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.  Indeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.  @KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across \"seemingly\" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018  And so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.  We'd all love to have that skill.  On truly good days, we find it.  On most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.  Harnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.

        "Tom Cruise has seemingly been all about his movie career since his high-profile marriage to Katie Holmes met its demise. The action star has steadily starred in film after film, yet has been at the center of several dating rumors.  As the International Business Times reports, \u201cThe actor was mistakenly linked to an Australian journalist and then was associated to his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star and Crown actress Vanessa Kirby.\u201d  All rumors until now have been stamped out as false.  However, the latest claims include those stating that members of the Church of Scientology have once again been playing matchmaker for the Top Gun star and that Cruise has reportedly been secretly dating over the past little while. Interestingly enough, Tom has reportedly been using a disguise to enjoy dates with the ladies, much like Katie Holmes did in the initial stages of her romance with Jamie Foxx.  A source told the publication about Cruise\u2019s tactics to keep his love life out of the spotlight.  \u201cTom\u2019s back on the dating scene, but nobody knows it\u2019s him. His face is way too recognizable for him to stroll into the bars, so he has his makeup artist create a silicone mask. Seems like Tom took his Mission: Impossible role to heart. It\u2019s just what Ethan Hunt would do in the movies.\u201d  It\u2019s also been claimed that the disguise, which includes makeup, takes a full five hours to apply. If this rumor all sounds a little far-fetched, that\u2019s because it is completely untrue, according to Gossip Cop. Tom Cruise does not go through some elaborate process to secretly step out on dates. In fact, there has not been any confirmation that Tom Cruise has dated anyone since Katie Holmes.  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images  Katie Holmes, however, continues to attempt to keep her romance with Jamie Foxx a secret, despite the fact that the pair has been spotted on numerous occasions over the past year on beach getaways and romantic locales like Paris. Most recently the mysterious duo were spotted celebrating Jamie\u2019s 50th birthday at a Santa Monica beach hotel last week, as Page Six relays.  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted on another romantic beach getaway https://t.co/ZwdutxFdYe pic.twitter.com/dhoszJ2wg3 \u2014 Travel + Leisure (@TravelLeisure) December 19, 2017  Onlookers at the hotel stated that the duo appeared to be quite awkward while Katie kept looking around cautiously. The couple was also seen walking along the beach while Foxx had his arm around the beauty. This report is similar to the one earlier this year that stated Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted strolling along the beach hand-in-hand in Malibu.",

        "Whatever your preconceptions about Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the hit 10-years-in-the-running show contains some seriously emotional storylines.  If you look past all the staring into iPhone screens, those daily delivered box salads and the 'like, seriously' slang, there's some genuinely stirring stuff in there.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  What about Kim relaying the story of her terrifying ordeal in Paris? Khloe's fertility concerns? Scott and Courtney's frighteningly dysfunctional relationship?  Well, if you've shed the odd tear for the Ks over the years, you aren't alone.  In the family's celebratory Hollywood Reporter cover story, Kendall explained to the magazine that members of the crew can't help sobbing when one of the girls opens up.  Hollywood reporter A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Aug 16, 2017 at 8:26am PDT  She said, 'We have such a personal relationship with the crew. When one of us cries on the show usually you'll look around and the camera guy is crying and the producer is crying'  Kim added, 'It really is an intimate relationship. These people see every last thing.'  The crew can go from anything from one iPhone to a 30-strong team, all watching their every move.  THE KARDASHIAN DECADE A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Aug 16, 2017 at 6:39am PDT  Whoever was on set would have also been privy to Kendall's reaction to the politically insensitive Pepsi advert she was must-lambasted for. Though we as a public have received no evidence of how Kendall reacted to the onslaught of criticism (she has deleted all evidence of it on her social media and has never made a statement), Kim explains that Kendall would never let herself be shown on camera crying.  She told the magazine:  We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.' She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.  We suppose the only non-family members who know the truth are those blubbering crew members then.",

        "First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with \u201cheavy sedatives\u201d smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump\u2019s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a \u201cslower, damaged version\u201d.  \u201cBy 8pm he is slurring,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the man I know.\u201d  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  \u201cDonald\u2019s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,\u201d Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is \u201ca high level operation\u201d and \u201cnot the work of a solitary loon.\u201d  Melania is popular in the White House\u2014as she is with the rest of the country\u2014and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan\u2019s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a \u201cbrain damaged\u201d state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump\u2019s food choices say a lot about the man. The president\u2019s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn\u2019t trust those around him \u2013 and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president\u2019s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence\u2019s meal was not unusual\u2014he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.",
        "When the Spice Girls made their video for the hit song Say You\u2019ll Be There in 1996 at the height of their fame, they knew that it was an important moment in their pop careers.  But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.  The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.  He declared: \u201cThat\u2019s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.\u201d  They later met at a Manchester United soccer players\u2019 lounge, where it was love at first sight\u2014although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.  The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.  However, it hasn\u2019t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David\u2019s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.  The couple\u2019s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.  David retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.  He has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth\u2014a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.  As their marriage nears the two decade mark, we look back at the couple\u2019s best moments. From spray-tanned party animals to chic and professional parents, these pictures show just how far they\u2019ve come.",

PHOTOS: Iggy's red carpet style The loved-up couple have been inseparable for the past few months. In June the chart topping singer celebrated her birthday with a trip to Mexico with Young. And as Us Weekly previously reported, pals of the pair are anticipating an engagement announcement. PHOTOS: Iggy at the Grammys \"They only have a good time together,\" the source told Us. \"It's a really fun relationship, they are always laughing and having fun.

Katy Perry Slams Unnamed Mean Girl Paging Taylor Swift? In the early hours of Tuesday, Sept. 9, Katy Perry took to Twitter to warn her 56.7 million followers of an unnamed mean girl \u2014 less than 24 hours after fresh speculation began of a supposed feud between Perry and Swift. \"Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing\u2026\" Perry, 29, tweeted without context on Tuesday, referencing the lead character and ultimate mean girl, played by Rachel McAdams, who faced off against Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan, in the hit 2004 comedy Mean Girls. PHOTOS: Taylor Swift's Celebrity BFFs The cryptic words followed widespread chatter that there is tension between the \"This Is How We Do\" performer and Swift, 24. The drama started when the \"Shake It Off\" singer gave a revealing cover story interview for the new issue of Rolling Stone, and at one point during the sit-down, spoke tantalizingly of issues she has with another famous female artist. PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever Said artist is the subject of a song called \"Bad Blood,\" which is featured on Swift's upcoming album, 1989. Explaining the song's inspiration, she told Rolling Stone, \"For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'\u2026 She did something so horrible. I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.' And it wasn't even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational \u2014 you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it.\" While Swift mentioned that the feud wasn't about a boy, she and Perry both famously dated John Mayer, and Rolling Stone notes that when \"pressed,\" Swift said there was a personal aspect to the drama, \"but I don't think there would be any personal problem if she weren't competitive.\" Both chart-topping women were also on tour beginning in February 2011, with Perry wrapping in January 2012 and Swift in March 2012. PHOTOS: Katy Perry's Craziest Style Moments For her part, Swift chose not to offer further clues as to the inspiration for \"Bad Blood.\" Other artists whose names have been included in the talk include Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato. In an online watercooler poll at Us Weekly, 70 percent of more than 8,500 readers who voted guessed the song was about Cyrus. Bachelor in Paradise's Michelle and Cody Want to Wed -- Maybe on TV!

        "The rumor mill is churning out some fake news about Barbados' own Rihanna.  In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: \u2018If Jesus Hasn\u2019t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan\u2019, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  \"You have to hustle. I\u2019m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y\u2019all the biggest one straight off...  \"If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.\"  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so \"believe in your dreams\", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  \"I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it\u2019s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.\u201d  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.

        "Kim Kardashian is allegedly \u201cphasing out\u201d mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That\u2019s according to a new report by Radar Online, who\u2019s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner \u201cused her\u201d to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now \u201cseems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,\u201d which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  \u201c[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,\u201d the source said of Jenner\u2019s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been \u201cusing\u201d her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian\u2019s career going forward.  \u201cKim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,\u201d the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that \u201cpart of this process includes phasing out [Kris\u2019s] management.\u201d  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner\u2019s \u201cmoney making machine\u201d after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she\u2019s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her \u201cmomager,\u201d had been controlling her life and career.  \u201cKim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,\u201d an insider told the site of Kardashian\u2019s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to \u201cphase out\u201d Kris from her career.  \u201cKim is just starting to think that maybe Kris\u2019s intentions were not pure all along,\u201d continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris\u2019s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  \u201c[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris\u2019s help,\u201d a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

        "Caitlyn Jenner told Diane Sawyer that she had undergone \"the final surgery\" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night's \"20/20\" special.  The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book \"The Secrets of My Life,\" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 \"surgery was a success.\"  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had \"no regrets, none whatsoever.\"  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, \"I\u2019m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.\"  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been \"happy, peaceful\u2026all of that confusion has left me\u2026.I did the right thing\" -- and doesn't miss \"Bruce\" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how\u2014when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: \"When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.\"  As many know from her former reality show, \"I Am Cait,\" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, \"Yes, I did vote for Trump.\"  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, \"He wanted me to come play golf with him.\"  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  \"It was extremely disappointing\u2026you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,\" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is \"what's between your ears.\"  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  \"Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,\" commented the former \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has \"never been on a date\" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  \"I want to fight this fight,\" she vowed.

        "Lou Rocco/Getty Images  How Michael Strahan\u2019s net worth was built  Michael Strahan has grown his wealth through 14 years of playing pro football and his second career as a talk-show host.  The son of an Army major, Strahan grew up in Germany and did not play competitive high school football until his senior year when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Texas.  The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league\u2019s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa\u2019s \u201cLive! With Kelly\u201d co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d; it took more than a year for \u201cLive\u201d to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan\u2019s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.  You can use this net worth calculator to see your net worth.  Michael Strahan  Born: 1971  Birthplace: Houston  What he\u2019s up to now  Strahan hung up his jersey in 2008, but he did not retire quietly. As of April 2016, he is a full-time co-host on ABC\u2019s morning show \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d  Months later, the network hired him to host his own game show, \u201c$100,000 Pyramid,\u201d a reboot of an old classic. The fashionable football star also launched his own clothing line in 2015 in JC Penney stores.  Along with Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, Strahan appears on \u201cFox NFL Sunday\u201d each week during the NFL season.  Accolades  Throughout both his college and pro football careers, Strahan had a reputation for sacking quarterbacks, and in 2001, he set the record for most sacks in an NFL season. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl seven times.  In 2008, after his final season in the NFL, he helped lead the New York Giants to a Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots.  As a morning show host, Strahan has earned two Daytime Emmy Awards for \u201cOutstanding Talk Show Host\u201d for his work on \u201cLive! With Kelly and Michael.\u201d",
        "Caitlyn Jenner is planning to take it all off for a nude photo shoot, DailyMail.com can disclose.  Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, \u2018The Secrets of My Life\u2019. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be \u2018wholly supportive\u2019 of Jenner\u2019s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is \u2018their worst nightmare\u2019.  Caitlyn Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according her memoir, \u2018The Secrets of My Life\u2019. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be \u2018wholly supportive\u2019 of Jenner\u2019s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is \u2018their worst nightmare\u2019  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old\u2019s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  \u2018Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that\u2019s unacceptable, it\u2019s taking things too far,' the source said.  \u2018They\u2019re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner\u2019s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  \u2018She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,\u2019 said the source. \u2018But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making \u2018I am Cait\u2019 shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated [\u2026] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  \u2018I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner\u2019s \u2018unpredictable\u2019 behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: \u2018[The book] is definitely something that she\u2019s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  \u2018But the family were like, it\u2019s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  \u2018They were worried because she\u2019s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.\u2019  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson\u2019s defense team during his 1",
        "Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of \u201cuncomfortable questions\u201d by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  \u201cThe petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,\u201d Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  \u201cThere is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,\u201d Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna \u201cis motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.\u201d  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna\u2019s adoptions in Malawi. \u201cIn determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,\u201d the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi \u201cto check on the children\u2019s hospital in Blantyre.\u201d) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna\u2019s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins\u2019 mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. \u201cI can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,\u201d she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. \u201cI am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!\u201d  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

        "2.4k SHARES Share TweetPhotos of arrested illegal immigrants from cage-like cells moved viral this weekend. Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump\u2019s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they\u2019re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president\u2019s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump\u2019s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They\u2019ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn\u2019t hesitate to question his children\u2019s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals \u2014 arrested by our government \u2014 were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,\u201dFirst glance of immigrant kids at holding facility\u201d and said\u201dThis is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible\u201dHis obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let\u2019s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That\u2019s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama\u2019s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren\u2019t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn\u2019t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members\u201danimals,\u201d Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama\u2019s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump\u2019s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...",

        "During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to \u201cquiet that annoying ass baby down.\u201dAfter the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother\u2019s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.",
        "Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.Have this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.The true explanation is much less exciting.Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state\u2019s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.",

Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team\u2019s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., \u201cDid you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?\u201d she answered: \u201cNot to my knowledge. I didn\u2019t see him with it.\u201dThe question was then asked, \u201cAnd as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera \u2013 with a camera or a phone?\u201dK.S. replied, \u201cCorrect.\u201dThe counsel then asked, \u201cAnd you can\u2019t say you saw it on his person, you can\u2019t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?\u201dK.S. answered, \u201cYes. I cannot say.\u201dTrying to salvage the state\u2019s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., \u201cDid you see what you believed to be a phone?\u201dHere comes the shocker. K.S. answered, \u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t talked about it because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m remembering it through a dream or I \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven\u2019t spoken about it because of that.\u201dK.S. remembered the photo incident \u201cthrough a dream\u201d? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.\u2019s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.",
        "It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, \u201cincluding thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama\u2019s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges\u2013 no trial\u2013just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 \u2014 teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught \u2014 and he wanted to attack this loophole. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?\u201d Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents\u2019 knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held \u2014 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don\u2019t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in \u201cfacilities\u201d so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.\u201cOur concern is that the program\u2019s real intent is to interrogate the kids,\u201d said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are \u201coften questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.\u201d While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer\u2019s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative\u2019s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico\u201cThe moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn\u2019t an announcement,\u201d said Reyna Torres Mend\u00edvil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry\u2019s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. \u201cWhere were they taking these children?\u201dRegarding prevent",

        "Denzel\u2019s recent comments about the \u201cOrwellian Police State\u201d is so very apparent, given the FBI, DNC, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama scandal inside the administration\u2019s treasonous activity in having the Clinton Foundation pay for a fake dossier, made by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, which they hoped would create false allegations which would concede Donald Trump\u2019s Presidential victory. This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller\u2019s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, \u201cIf the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!\u201dDenzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film \u2018Roman J. Israel, Esq.\u2019 (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didn\u2019t pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: \u201cThey would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections\u201d.When a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was \u201creliable\u201d, he responded, \u201cHell yeah, it\u2019s reliable. We don\u2019t need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly what\u2019s happened here\u201d.\u201cWe know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.\u201d\u201cYou guys can\u2019t see what is wrong with this? You\u2019re kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign?\u201dDenzel Washington then later called out individual reporters and media outlets for never publishing anything negative about the Democrat Party, and subsequently hiding their scandals from any in-depth news output.Denzel continued, \u201cI grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you\u2019ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State\u201d.We couldn\u2019t agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didn\u2019t constitute complete treason?The double standards are \u201coh so\u201d apparent, and it\u2019s good to see somebody high up in celebrity circles like Denzel Washington to be brave enough speak out on these pressing issues, and helping to expose the scandals of the Democrat Party.",

        "Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person\u2019s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn\u2019t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.Fact-checking largely didn\u2019t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don\u2019t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. \"We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,\" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.CNN has also released a statement: \u201cThe RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.\u201d But that still doesn\u2019t really verify that anything occurred.@solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an \u2014 RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016@solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa \u2014 RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It\u2019s a layup for body-part puns.This is exactly how fake news spreadsBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it\u2019s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won\u2019t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.",

        "Share Us.A 78-year old retired officer of the CIA, Normand Hodges, has made a series of astonishing confessions. He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James \u201cJimmy\u201d Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the \u201cthe CIA had its own agenda\u201d. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists \u2013 all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant \u201cthreat to the security of the country\u201d and had to be eliminated.\u201cWe had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro\u201d, says M. Hodges. \u201cMy commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders\u2026 I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn\u2019t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!\u201dMarilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal \u2013 a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA\u2019s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren\u2019t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!",
        "How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?If they don\u2019t want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from. This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.Wouldn\u2019t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn\u2019t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they\u2019re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if \u201cwestern culture\u201d offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a \u201cdisputed view\u201d of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, \u201cRequiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of \u2018forced assimilation\u2019 of the Muslim community.\u201dHere\u2019s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can\u2019t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here\u2019s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We\u2019ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature\u2019s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history\u2019s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We\u2019ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who\u2019ve come across the seas We\u2019ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.Super oppressive lyrics, right?If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter\u2026it\u2019s really that simple.Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation\u2019s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It\u2019s their faith. The west doesn\u2019t get it because most liberals are faithless.It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don\u2019t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian\u2019s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn\u2019t pray\u2026 but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won\u2019t want to learn the country they have invaded history\u2026 because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?",

        "According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had \u201cno value\u201d and were \u201clike ISIS,\u201d and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 \u2014 $8,832.73 per month \u2014 according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera \u201chas a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as \u2018n*ggers'\u201d. One of Nucera\u2019s officers \u201cmade numerous recordings\u201d of Nucera that \u201ccontained extremely offensive racist comments\u201d over the course of a year because he was \u201calarmed\u201d by Nucera\u2019s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn\u2019t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police \u201cescalated into a physical struggle,\u201d that both teens \u201cresisted arrest\u201d and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old\u2019s head and slammed it \u201cinto the right side of the metal doorjamb,\u201d according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old\u2019s head make \u201ca loud thud\u201d as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn\u2019t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had \u201cstopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.\u201d The use of force wasn\u2019t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was \u201cf*cking tired\u201d of African-Americans.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cAnd that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,\u201d he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl\u2019s aunt, who was present at the arrest. \u201cFucking nipple hanging bitch. I\u2019m so tired of them, man.\u201dNucera allegedly said that black people should \u201cstay the fuck out of Bordentown\u201d and referred to the 18-year-old as \u201cfucking little, fucking n****r.\u201dIn a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to \u201cput my hands\u201d on him.\u201cThese n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cThey should line them all up and mow \u2019em down. I\u2019d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\u201cThe conduct alleged is shocking,\u201d acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.\u201cIt\u2019s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.\u201dAdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.",
        "Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin\u2019s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account \u2014 backed by documents \u2014 indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBill Clinton's novel sees fastest fiction sales in two years From Singapore, skepticism and hope The Memo: Summit gives Trump political boost \u2014 with risks MORE\u2019s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSessions defends firing Comey, warns DOJ report could prompt more terminations Sanders gets best reception at early 2020 audition Hillicon Valley: DHS gets new cyber chief | White House warns lawmakers not to block ZTE deal | White nationalists find home on Google Plus | Comcast outbids Disney for Fox | Anticipation builds for report on FBI Clinton probe MORE served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted \u201cwith the consent of higher level officials\u201d in Russia who \u201cshared the proceeds\u201d from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.ADVERTISEMENTRather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin\u2019s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton\u2019s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she \u201cnever intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.\u201dIn 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom\u2019s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.\u201cThe Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration\u2019s decision to approve Rosatom\u2019s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That\u2019s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee\u2019s decision that Vadim Mikerin \u2014 the main Russian overseeing Putin\u2019s nuclear expansion inside the United States \u2014 was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderHolder redistricting group backs lawsuits for 3 additional majority-black congressional districts Liberal groups launches ads against prospective Trump Supreme Court nominees Ready for somebody? Dems lack heir apparent this time MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn\u2019t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom\u2019s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom\u2019s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom\u2019s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin \u201cdid knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons \u2026 to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,\u201d a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin\u2019s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin",

        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department gifted an \u201cunknown number\u201d of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called \u201ccaregivers,\u201d according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government\u2019s handling of migrants.\u201cIt is intolerable that human trafficking \u2014 modern-day slavery \u2014 could occur in our own backyard,\u201d Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. \u201cBut what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.\u201dAs detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans \u2014 and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers\u2019 homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate\u2019s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.",
        "We all know that the recently passed tax bill is likely the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics. You know it, I know it, Paul Ryan knows it, Donald Trump knows it. Well, Trump probably doesn\u2019t, because, well, he\u2019s delusional.But it\u2019s really, really bad. And historically unpopular, like the President whose name will forever be attached to it.Maybe you aren\u2019t totally convinced about how bad it is yet.

That isn\u2019t stopping him, however, from nicking their wallets in the new tax law that he is expected to sign in early January.Buried in the hastily drafted tax bill\u2019s more than 500 pages are provisions eliminating \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d deductions taken by almost 28 million taxpayers in 2015. Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.This year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.But that\u2019s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.Add police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer. And all to give the wealthiest among us more wealth.Shameful.",
        "President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.Trump told the crowd the following: \u201cPolice officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn\u2019t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.\u201dObama\u2019s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn\u2019t be offended. Apparently it\u2019s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm\u2019s way to save the innocent to be honored.President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all.

Late last night Greensburg police received a phone call from a worried resident saying \"she heard very concerning sounds coming from an alley way near her house\". Upon arrival officers instantly heard the noise she was talking about but never expected what they where about to see. Upon investigation they found a 21 year old male dressed as a clown eating a live cat who's legs were zip tied together. The cat was still crying for help as the individual was seemingly eating around the vital spots prolonging it's death. When he noticed the officers he started petting the cat and told the officers \"curiosity killed the cat, I wanted to see if it tasted like Chinese food.\" He was non resistant during arrest however did not have identification when asked his name he always replied \"furball munchinsrein the clown\". In the holding cell it was reported he kept calling to a female officer \"here kitty kitty kitty\" she eventually approached him and said what he reportedly said \"I wonder if you taste like Chinese food come on just let me get one little bite\" and continued to bite at the cells bars. He is now in a high security prison for the criminally insane. It was reported that in the asylum he bit open his own fingers and painted himself as a clown with his own blood and refuses to answer questions and instead meows. His trial is on the 31st however police say they doubt he will ever be allowed back into society.",

        "The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews can\u2019t keep up with the calls that continue to pour in. President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it\u2019s time to take urgent action as he\u2019s announced in a shocking message to Americans.With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.\u201cFebruary\u2019s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,\u201d Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he\u2019s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build \u201ca great, great wall along our southern border\u201d \u2014 in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an \u201cunprecedented rate.\u201d \u201cOur terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,\u201d Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported.

American values of privacy and freedom make it very difficult to prohibit anything as mainstream as tobacco, even if it\u2019s to save the lives of smokers. That old \u201cnanny state\u201d argument rears its head every time.

        "First Lady Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a complete exorcism, with \u201cpagan idols and demonic artifacts\u201d from \u201cthe Clinton and Obama years\u201d removed from the premises before she would set foot in the building, according to White House pastor Paul Begley.\u201cI\u2019m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,\u201d Melania Trump told Pastor Begley.\u201cThey cleansed the White House,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cThey had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.\u201dAfter the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left \u2013 a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.\u201cBecause apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,\u201d Begley said.The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, \u201c\u2018You\u2019ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests\u2018\u201d \u2013 she wanted respected Christian leaders \u2014 to go in and cleanse the White House or, \u2018I will not spend one night in it.\u2019\u201d\u201cI have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him\u2014seven times he\u2019s done this\u2014that is unheard of,\u201d Begley said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t ever \u2013 the guy\u2019s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.\u201dPastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged \u201cspirit arrived,\u201d possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is \u2013 an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, \u201cWith fingers crossed, the old rabbit\u2019s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .\u201dLater that year Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic \u201cspirit cooking\u201d dinner parties, featuring pig\u2019s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.With previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building.",

        "athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn\u2019t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she\u2019s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it\u2019s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say \u201ceeeeewwwwwww\u201d right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that\u2019s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here\u2019s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: \u201cThe event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump \u2014 which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year\u2019s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper \u2014 was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a \u201csideshow\u201d for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn\u2019t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine\u2019s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal.

        "An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall.Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, said he didn\u2019t want to take sides in the gun-control debate consuming the country. If he went outside for the walkout, he said, he would be supporting gun control. If he stayed in the common area of the school, he said, he would be seen as supporting gun violence and disrespecting the 17 lives lost in the Parkland, Fla. High school shooting the month before.Jacob had met with the school\u2019s principal on Tuesday, a day before the rally, for about an hour to find out what exactly the walkout was supporting.

        "The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, \u201cThis is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.\u201dAccording to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",

        "Pope Francis\u2019s latest controversial statement \u2013 that \u201cJesus is metaphorical, not literal\u201d \u2013 has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Francis\u2019s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT \u2018JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN\u2019Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of \u201cdebasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself\u201d, and \u201cturning into Satan.\u201dHardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it\u2019s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ \u201cmade himself the devil, the serpent, for us,\u201d according to L\u2019Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE \u2018HARMFUL\u2019The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that \u201ca personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ\u201d must be avoided at all costs.\u201cHaving a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,\u201d the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR \u2018ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT\u2019In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has \u201ca distorted vision of the world\u201d and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, \u201cfor their own good.\u201dThe week before he also called for \u201ca one world government\u201d and \u201cpolitical authority\u201d, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as \u201cclimate change.\u201dSpeaking with Ecuador\u2019s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control \u201cfor the good of humanity.\u201dFrance\u2019s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a \u201cglobalist bulldog\u201c. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis\u2019s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis\u2019s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis\u2019s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question \u2013 is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?",

He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has \u201censhrined sodomy into the United States Constitution\u201d and cities like Houston are trying to \u201cforce women to go into men\u2019s bathrooms and men to go into women\u2019s bathrooms.\u201d\u201cNow it\u2019s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,\u201d he lamented, warning that \u201cthe wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.\u201d He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it\u2019s a great country, I\u2019d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we\u2019re going to have this financial collapse. We\u2019re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that\u2019s probably the way he\u2019d do it.\u201dAt that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: \u201cI believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.\u201d\u201cI personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I\u2019m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,\u201d Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d host to state that \u201cthat sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,\u201d referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Robertson quickly became defensive. \u201cI am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps.

        "Snoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video \u201cLavender,\u201d in which he shoots Donald Trump. In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that\u2019s not what got him in trouble.After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:\u201cNo, man. I don\u2019t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin\u2019 that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That\u2019s not violence\u2026it\u2019s survival of the species.\u201dThe reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he\u2019s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump\u2019s America if you say and do stupid crap.[Via Stryker]",

        "The FDA has published conclusive proof on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism.According to the FDA\u2019s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.What\u2019s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?According to the Tripedia\u2019s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.What is the content of these two growth mediums?Mueller and Miller medium, contains:Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution.

Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 \u03bcg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde.

        "January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn\u2019s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa\u2019s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles \u2013 but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie\u2019s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride\u2019s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer\u2019s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.\u201cI remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you\u2019re seeing people for the last time,\u201d the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen\u2019s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride\u2019s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness \u2013 her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride\u2019s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:\u201cI was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t go back there. It\u2019s bad,\u2019\u201d Michael Tangney said. \u201cI opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.\u201dBut, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter\u2019s head in her hands. Katie\u2019s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie\u2019s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter\u2019s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder \u2013 though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer\u2019s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.\u201cSince no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,\u201d Jennifer said.\u201cI hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.\u201dThe fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I\u2019m sure y",

        "Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump \u201cResistance.\u201d She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill\u2019s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects \u201ccreditably\u201d on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been \u201cworthless\u201d if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the \u201cspirit\u201d of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of \u201cspecial favors.\u201dThe charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank \u2026 As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters\u2019s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money \u2014 despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated \u201cwithout effective underwriting standards\u201d and engaged \u201cin speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited\u2019s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters\u2019s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters\u2019s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters\u2019s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times. Resist.",

        "We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it\u2019s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you\u2019re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you\u2019re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who\u2019re willing to take part in their \u201cRest Studies\u201d \u2013 a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts\u2019 health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts\u2019 changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts\u2019 physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study\u2019s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you\u2019re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you\u2019ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you\u2019ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You\u2019ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body\u2019s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can\u2019t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you\u2019ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net",

        "usapoliticsnow admin.A string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23-year-old case that had gone completely cold. After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster\u2019s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn\u2019t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital\u2019s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible..The doctor who signed Foster\u2019s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice..The case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster\u2019s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau\u2019s resources are made available..In other words, Clinton will be getting away with murder\u2026again..",

        "9.6k SHARES Share Tweet ShareDe Soto, Missouri \u2013 Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family\u2019s living room.Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.The 16-year-old babysitter named \u2018Anna Ritchie\u2019, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.\u201cI just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,\u201d she told Officer Robert. \u201cAll I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out\u201d recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield\u2019s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.\u201cApparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,\u201d explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. \u201cTeeth marks were found on the baby\u2019s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed\u201d he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts.

        "HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It\u2019s NOT PRETTY \u2026 FOR THEM\u201cThe tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\u201d \u2013 Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT \u2013 Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson\u2019s directive to their own detriment. It\u2019s no longer political, it\u2019s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump\u2019s America First agenda and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don\u2019t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.\u201dCandidate Trump promised many things \u2013 border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and \u2013 to the extent possible \u2013 an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans \u2013 notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham \u2013 have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp.\u201dAs we reported yesterday, \u201cAn F.B.I. agent with \u2018intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case\u2019 told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.\u201dThe criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn\u2019t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation\u2019s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children\u2019s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren\u2019t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump\u2019s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It\u2019s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.And, now that they\u2019ve been caught robbing the world\u2019s largest bank \u2013 the U.S. treasury \u2013 they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.Washington\u2019s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It\u2019s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly.

In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, \u201cThe government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn\u2019t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn\u2019t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a \u2018religion of peace\u2019 when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.\u201dGorsuch continued, \u201cIt is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.\u201dThe Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the \u201cReligion of Peace,\u201d only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists.

They really beat him. It's appalling \u2014 like something you would see in a war zone,\" she said.\u201cHe looks terrible,\" she continues.\"His left eye is like a golf ball and bleeding, the nose looks like it could be broken.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t had an x-ray yet.\"He doesn\u2019t remember anything.\"The first thing he remembers is the police.\u201cHe is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.\u201cNothing was taken, but the transport police intervened quickly.\"London is such a beautiful, wonderful city.\"We can't start worrying about walking in the streets at 3 pm.\"\u00a9 press The 74-year-old retired diplomat, pictured with his wife, was beaten to a pulp for his political viewDaily Mail reports: Cambridge-educated Sir Christopher worked as press secretary for former chancellor Geoffrey Howe and John Major before being appointed US ambassador.He spent six years in Washington, from 1997 to 2003, becoming the longest-serving holder of his office since 1945.As ambassador, he welcomed around 35,000 guests to his home a year and was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.After retiring, he became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the former newspaper regulatory body.He is a prolific tweeter, who regularly comments on politics and foreign affairs.The former diplomat has called for Britain to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit today.He has been married to Catherine for more than 20 years.Sir Christopher's attack comes as London's crime rate has soared.Since the start of the year, more than 80 murder investigations have been launched in the capital.Forces in England and Wales logged 5.3million crimes in the year to September 2017, 14 percent up on the previous 12 months.A statement from the British Transport Police (BTP) said:\"Officers were called to Victoria London Underground Station at 2.45pm yesterday (11 July), after receiving reports that a man had been seriously assaulted.\"A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon were both arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm.\"They have been released under investigation while inquiries into the incident continue.\"A man in his seventies was taken to hospital, though his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or changing.\"Thoughts with former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, who was brutally attacked yesterday.

        "335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their \u201canatomical sex:\u201dLocal school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student\u2019s rights.

        "By AM Conservative Post authorFareed Zakaria, CNN host of \u2018Foreign Affairs,\u2019 has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.Zakaria\u2019s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.\u201cThe white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the \u2018white question\u2019 will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.\u201dThe blog post was removed from Zakaria\u2019s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.\u201cEvery death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,\u201d Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum",

        "\u2018Smallville\u2019 star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: \u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants\u2019 benefit,\u201d U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.\u201cSome people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,\u201d Oxenberg said. \u201cCoercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.\u201dWhen these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney\u2019s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack\u2019s arrest report or charges\u2014as reported by the mainstream media\u2014will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is tru",

She gathered up her stuff and left, together with the rest of her celebration.Vice noted:But despite all the backlash she\u2019s gotten from the right, Stephanie Wilkinson says she does not regret a thing.\u201cWe simply felt there are moments in time when folks need to live their own convictions. This appeared to be one.\u201dWhen Sanders came to the Red Hen along with her husband along with six other people on Friday night, the boxer called Wilkinson to mention the team was\u201da little concerned,\u201d Wilkinson told the Post.She headed to the restaurant, and\u2013while Sanders and her friends munched on cheeseboards\u2013called the team to a huddle in the kitchen, and asked if they wanted Sanders to leave. According to the Article, a handful of her workers are gay, and many others are revulsed by Sanders\u2019 treatment of this emergency at the boundary. They wanted her gone.Wilkinson took Sanders out into the patio and asked her to leave, telling her why the restaurant had\u201dcertain criteria\u201d like\u201dhonesty, and compassion, and collaboration,\u201d Wilkinson told the Post. Sanders agreed to proceed, gathered up her things, and headed out, followed by the remainder of her party, whose meal Wilkinson comped.Following the White House Press Secretary identified the place by name on Twitter, President Trump called it\u201dfilthy,\u201d and a army of his assistants got busy screwing with its business\u2013beginning a campaign to make a bunch of bogus dinner reservations and tanking its score on Yelp.I always had a guideline, if a restaurant is filthy on the outside, it\u2019s dirty on the inside!The restaurant\u2019s Yelp page has been bombarded with over 11,000 one-star reviews, leaving it in a sound one-and-a-half.Piggybacking on Trump\u2019s dig on the area being\u201dfilthy,\u201d several pissed-off reviewers have claimed to have discovered roaches in their food because Sanders was kicked out, but some have compared Wilkinson to a Nazi and called her and her staff\u201dun-American hateful bigots.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve a company, and I want the company to flourish. This feels just like the moment in our democracy when people need to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to maintain their morals.\u201dSaturday afternoon the Press Secretary hadn\u2019t any difficulty in telling her story and actually named the establishment on Twitter, which was followed by President Trump calling it\u201dfilthy\u201d on his Twitter page.Which in turn led to a military people deplorables wasting no time whatsoever in creating our feelings heard on social networking, on Yelp and by creating fake dinner reservations in demonstration.

The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (\"I want equal pay! And a chardonnay\") to dating and other social issues.Though Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.By jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central \u2014 and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network\u2019s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.Looking ahead, Wolf's Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The President\u2019s Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.Wolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman.",

As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.Mateo said via Fox News \u2013 \u201cWhile undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.\u201dTrending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! \u2018That Is Not Acceptable Here \u2013 I Won\u2019t Allow It!\u2019Senate Bill 174 made Mateo\u2019s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.\u201cCalifornia is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,\u201d Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill\u2019s author said in a statement. \u201cUndocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can\u2019t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.\u201dIt marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De Le\u00f3n\u2019s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo\u2019s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting \u2013 In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did. I always went for it bc even if I felt inadequate I thought I could add something of value.

(@LizbethMateo) March 15, 2018Interestingly enough, however, Moteo seems to be confused about which country she prefers and which country has her loyalty. In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish \u2013\u201cEverything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.\u201dIf she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.It is important to note that while Mateo is the first \u201cunprotected\u201d illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.De Le\u00f3n and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.Many were also quick to point out Mateo\u2019s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law. One Twitter user asked Mateo some very pointed and direct questions \u2013 \u201cAs someone who studies and practices the law, how can you at the same time flout the very principles of justice that law and order is based on?!?! You are a fraud and should answer for breaking the laws of this land.\u201dIn #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis \u2013 videoCharlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read moreThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: \u201cA gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan.

When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: \u201cJew! Jew! Jew!\u201dAround the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds.

        "The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company\u2019s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and \u201crunning Mall of America into the ground,\u201d on the basis of Santa \u201calways having been white in the Bible.\u201d \u201cNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,\u201d Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was \u201cthe last straw\u201d in corporate America\u2019s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, \u201cbecause they realized they couldn\u2019t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they\u2019ve been using so far.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won\u2019t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don\u2019t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,\u201d Palin added. \u201cThe Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don\u2019t, if we let them get away with it, what\u2019s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we\u2019re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that\u2019s happening by accident?\u201d\u201cNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,\u201d she concluded.",
        "Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,\u201d said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. \u201cBut Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he\u2019s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump\u2019s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President\u2019s ice cream from the carton.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President\u2019s eating habits to the press.\u201cIt\u2019s borderline creepy,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThe first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he\u2019s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It\u2019s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s McDonalds habits are even weirder.\u201cHe orders the same thing every time,\u201d said the staffer. \u201cHe orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M\u2019s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.\u201dNo wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit.

        "USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionYou might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can\u2019t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama\u2019s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico \u2014 and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don\u2019t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it \u2014 because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com",

        "A senior Iranian cleric and member of parliament has just dropped a bombshell.He is claiming that the Obama administration, as part of negotiating during the Iran Deal, granted U.S. citizenship to 2500 Iranians including family members of government officials.From Fox News:Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran\u2019s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the country\u2019s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country\u2019s Fars News agency. He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.\u201cWhen Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIf today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.\u201d The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s inner circle, added: \u201cIt should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.\u201dHe said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. \u201cagainst our national interests.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear who he\u2019s talking about and whether he\u2019s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.But it obviously raises a concerning question.There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to believe.And it shouldn\u2019t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can\u2019t get a straight answer.Asked about the cleric\u2019s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.\u201d Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official\u2019s allegation. \u201cThis sounds like totally made up BS,\u201d she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran\u2019s elite. \u201cMany ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,\u201d Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. \u201cThe regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.\u201d Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: \u201cIranians don\u2019t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of t",

        "There is not a day that goes by that we don\u2019t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn\u2019t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called \u201creligion of peace\u201d are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for \u201cIslam anti-blasphemy\u201d laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis\u2019 local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to \u201charass them.\u201d The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city\u2019s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any \u201charassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,\u201d according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.\u201cSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.\u201dThe city\u2019s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: \u201cI will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump\u2019s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.\u201d The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal\u2019s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don\u2019t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don\u2019t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim\u2019s demands. This \u201canti-blasphemy\u201d hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Ger",
        "It\u2019s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you\u2019re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it\u2019s important to realize that the fight isn\u2019t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That\u2019s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it\u2019s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about \u201cany and all\u201d files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled \u201cBlocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.\u201d\u201cI, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.\u201dNearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did \u201cundermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.\u201d Due to Soros\u2019s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn\u2019t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It\u2019s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary\u2019s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared \u201cit is the central focus of my life\u201d and \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary\u2019s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying \u201cdemocracy is now in crisis.\u201d Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn\u2019t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it\u2019s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It\u2019s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for fund",
        "Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcriptPrepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.Together, united in the",
        "Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. \u201cWe thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there\u2019s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting\u201d, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. \u201cThey are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal\u201d, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. \u201cHopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern\u201d, said Dr. Polowotski. \u201cBoaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution\u201d. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. \u201cWe were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it\u201d, said Bob. \u201cWe were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think\u201d, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.",
        "Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city\u2019s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.As workers slung a strap around the statue\u2019s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.\u201cThis historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,\u201d Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.\u201cIt will be nice\u201d, Landrieu said, \u201cto see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.\u201dThe Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.\u201cWe would have preferred it to be in the daytime,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cso everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.\u201dBefore the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators \u2014 both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included \u201cWhere\u2019s Mitch?\u201d while opponents chanted, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.\u201dAs Fox news reported earlier, the mayor\u2019s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.",
        "Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff\u2019s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG\u2019s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI\u2019s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201cWe constantly promote \u2018see something, say something,\u2019 and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. \u2018See something, say something\u2019 is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,\u201d Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel\u2019s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn\u2019t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine\u2019s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel\u2019s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel\u2019s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff\u2019s car that read, \u201cOur new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?\u201dThe tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike ",

The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for \u201cspeaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior\u201d \u2013 which she said had \u201cshaken (her) to the core.\u201d\u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d Pence argued, \u201cI have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That\u2019s the first thing I don\u2019t quite get. Secondly, if she\u2019s the First Lady, shouldn\u2019t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What\u2019s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That\u2019s not what she should be doing.\u201dThe governor of Indiana also said that she \u201chas no business\u201d commenting on men and their \u201crestroom talk,\u201d as well as that that\u2019s not \u201cladylike behavior.\u201d \u201cNow, I know that the word \u2018lady\u2019 is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she\u2019s not behaving like one, at least as of late,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she was a real lady, she wouldn\u2019t be commenting on men\u2019s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIf we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn\u2019t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she\u2019s not only being vocal about it, but she\u2019s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can\u2019t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can\u2019t fool me, just like she can\u2019t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.\u201d\u201cHow many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?\u201d Pence asked. \u201cHe has apologized for it several times, and I really don\u2019t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, the first lady also thinks she\u2019s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\u201cThere is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn\u2019t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I\u2019m actually glad that\u2019s the case because when Donald wins, we\u2019ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,\u201d Pence concluded.",
        "A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore.Natural News reports:In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:\u201cAl Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the \u2018global warming\u2019 debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.\u201dClimate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.Al Gore\u2019s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 \u2013 a year that was touted as being \u201cthe hottest ever\u201d in the Earth\u2019s history \u2013 there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.Debunking the \u201c97 percent\u201d lieOn top of those \u201cinconvenient truths,\u201d the White House\u2019s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the \u201c97 percent\u201d statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.From the National Review:\u201cA 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.\u201dOther mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda \u2013 even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth \u2013 not human activity.Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoaxBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you\u2019re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 \u2013 largely due to investments in fake \u201cgreen tech\u201d companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.You might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.",

        "President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it\u2019s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn\u2019t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a \u2018discriminatory manner,\u2019 particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a \u2018no\u2019 vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the \u201cimposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.\u201dTo have a \u2018no\u2019 vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:\u201cIt is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.\u201d \u201cThis is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.\u201dSince taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.",
        "An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is \u201crigged.\u201dDan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an \u201cgangland-style execution\u201d, hours after blowing the whistle on the \u201crigged Super Bowl\u201d backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend.Goodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football League\u2019s Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl featuring the two teams.However Goodes went \u201coff-script\u201d in Minneapolis and was \u201cphysically removed\u201d from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as \u201ctotally corrupt\u201d and claiming the Super Bowl is \u201cfixed.\u201dTelling reporters that he is a \u201cfootball fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second\u201d, Goodes said \u201cFootball in America in 2018 doesn\u2019t need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test.\u201cI like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can\u2019t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won\u2019t allow it.\u201cFootball in America won\u2019t recover from this.\u201dEarly reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an \u201cgangland-style execution\u201d in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a \u201crigged game\u201d that will earn \u201cmaximum revenue\u201d for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.\u201cThis is the biggest scam in sports history,\u201d Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. \u201cThe Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.\u201d\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s scripted? I\u2019ve read the damn thing.\u201c\u201cYou need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can\u2019t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don\u2019t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn\u2019t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn\u2019t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.\u201d\u201cThe sad thing is that it\u2019s legal. Can you believe that? It\u2019s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.\u201dExplaining that the NFL is officially registered as \u201centertainment,\u201d Goodes said \u201cThe NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.\u201dThe NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as \u201centertainment\u201d rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate \u201cfranchises\u201d they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing \u201centertainment\u201d in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other \u201csport\u201d that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.\u201cHave you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn\u2019t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they\u2019re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every singl",

        "The Bumble Bee tuna processing plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., on Oct. 15, 2012. (Photo: Nick Ut, AP)Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon \u2014 even in fatalities.San Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that \"we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident.\" It said it disagreed with the charges filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and that it was \"exploring all options with respect to those charges.\"Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

        "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 \u2014 a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida\u2019s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida\u2019s Department of Children and Families (DCF) \u2014 the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida \u2014 confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.\u201cThe dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state\u2019s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,\u201d said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures \u2014 such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week \u2014 and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year \u2014 and every year after 2013 \u2014 is continuing.",

Commenters on Reddit, where the photo seems to have originated, quickly noted this and the very real similarities between the two sharks (note the small circular shadow just below the shark\u2019s belly.)Some sites have since realized their error. Neatorama, for example, has removed its story with the photo called \u201cThank you, Hurricane Irene: Shark in the street.\u201d We\u2019ve asked Channel 7 in Miami, which broadcast the user-submitted photo, if it plans to inform viewers about its fakeness. We will update this post if we hear back.This phenomenon is nothing new. After the death of Osama bin Laden, a fake photo of his body circulated on Arab news outlets. When the earthquake hit Japan, photographs of a damaged church started circulating. The church was located in Christchurch, New Zealand.What\u2019s the lesson here? If you see a picture of a dolphin hanging out in Central Park after Irene moves through the East Coast this weekend, you may want to investigate it further.More Hurricane Irene coverage from the Washington Post:Hurricane TrackerMassive Hurricane Irene resumes intensificationHurricane Irene to sock beaches, sweep D.C. metro regionA warm and summery calm before Irene; tropical storm warning issued",
        "320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That\u2019s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don\u2019t want migrants who can\u2019t fend for themselves. Maybe it\u2019s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It\u2019s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It\u2019s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what\u2019s happening in Germany, with Merkel\u2019s \u201ccome on in\u201d policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There\u2019s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that\u2019s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.\u201cJust this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,\u201d he stated on his weekly radio address. \u201cAs an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.\u201d\u201cYou cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.\u201dCompare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can\u2019t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers \u2013 and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job \u2013 but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j",
        "Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, \u201cRed Hen\u201d owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to \u201cproblematic\u201d ideas. Of course, they\u2019re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders\u2019 family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she\u2019s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson\u2019s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson\u2019s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.\u201cConsidering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,\u201d Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration\u2019s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining \u201cunaffiliated\u201d as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who\u2019d never stepped through their door.\u201cKindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,\u201d said a post on the family-owned restaurant\u2019s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location\u2019s rating has plummetted from \u201c4.8 stars to three-point-something.\u201d An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has \u201cabsolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.\u201dWilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn\u2019t enjoy \u201cconfrontation\u201d but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.\u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of confrontation,\u201d Wilkinson told The Post. \u201cI have a business, and I want the business to thrive.\u201d But, she went on to say, \u201cThis feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.\u201dWhen the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are \u201cNa",
        "Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday.Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma Gonz\u00e1lez has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]Gonz\u00e1lez, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine\u2019s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up Gonz\u00e1lez as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of Gonz\u00e1lez tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, Gonz\u00e1lez is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: \u2018No one would know your names\u2019 if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading \u201c#Vorw\u00e4rts!\u201d \u2014 the German word for \u201cforward\u201d and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl \u2014 Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was \u201csatire.\u201d It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: \u201cJust a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),\u201d referencing a user named \u201cLinda NRA Supporter\u201d who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan\u2019s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of Gonz\u00e1lez and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right\u2019s criticism of Hogg\u2019s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first \u201ctop news\u201d video that appears in a YouTube search for \u201cDavid Hogg\u201d is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to not just go after this kid,\u201d host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of Gonz\u00e1lez have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.\u201cEmma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,\u201d one meme shared on Reddit\u2019s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post\u2019s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).\u201cThis is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don\u2019t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,\u201d said a post on King\u2019s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of Gonz\u00e1lez at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics \u2014 a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.\u201cThe initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it\u2019s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. \u2018Boycott this, boycott that.\u2019 It\u2019s detracting from the actual discussions,\u201d Kashuv told The Post\u2019s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg\u2019s comments at the rally were \u201cegregious and inflammatory,\u201d Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg\u2019s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers",

        "Rasheed Thompson, 39 of Chicago, was arrested in connection with a series of dead bodies found in a freezer located in his basement. According to reports, the bodies had the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d carved into the foreheads of the corpses.The Chicago coroners office made a gruesome discovery today after several 911 calls were placed by neighbors regarding their concern of suspicious activity at the residence of Thompson. At approximately 8 p.m., police were dispatched to South Pulaski Road and West Lexington Street. Upon their arrival, their arrival, authorities were met by a group of residents at the corner where they assisted police in locating the home in question. Police proceeded to the 3000 Block of West Lexington Street where they located the home. Authorities knocked on the door of the residence and was met by an African-American male, who appeared to be in his late 30\u2019s and seemed to be \u201cunder the influence of drugs\u201d.Upon entering the home, authorities indicated that the home \u201csmelled of death\u201d. The power was off in the house however authorities found a gasoline powered generated running in the kitchen.\u201cA Black male, approximately in his 30\u2019s, opened the door with the smell of alcohol and marijuana on his body. He appeared to be somewhat disoriented and his speech was slurred. We asked him for permission to enter the premises, however he seems reluctant to allow us to enter,\u201d said Lt. Kyle Jennings. \u201cAfter a few seconds, he mumbled \u201cyes\u201d to us. Once we entered the home, we were met with a very foul odor as if something was dead in the home. The power was off so we used our flash lights to look around. As we approached the rear of the home, a light was on in the kitchen. We asked the occupant for his name. He identified himself and told us he lived with his grandmother. In the kitchen, we found several handsaws covered in blood. Mr. Thompson pushed one of the officers and ran downstairs through a half-opened door in the kitchen.\u201dRasheed Thompson, 39 of Chicago, was arrested in connection with a series of dead bodies found in a freezer located in his basement.

Jennings and two other officers chased Thompson down the stairs which is where the foul odor had gotten stronger. When the officers got to the basement, they found a series of freezers scattered around the basement. With no trace of Thompson, one officer continued to search for him as the other two pried opened three locked deep freezers. Upon their discovery, 11 decapitated bodies were found frozen, while the heads where in ziplock freezer bags. All of the bodies appeared to have been Caucasian women, possibly in their early to mid-20\u2019s. The heads that were found all had the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d carved into the foreheads. The bodies were were preserved, possibly from being stored in the deep freezers.The police radioed for back up and the other freezers were opened where 8 more bodies in similar condition were found, however one of the women was still alive. Authorities at the scene helped the woman out of the freezer and waited for paramedics to arrive.\u201cI was kidnapped by this Black guy after I left work earlier today. We talked for while at Starbucks, where I work, before everything happened. At first he seemed pretty nice but he had this weird twitch that happened every couple of minutes. He asked if he could walk me to my car and I said yes, but that is when everything went dark. When I woke up, I was in this basement and I saw that guy I was with earlier taking saws up the stairs. I cried for help and that is when he stuffed me into a freezer where I saw dead bodies. I must have passed out from shock or something but I am happy you guys found me,\u201d said to police by the victim.Officer Douglas, who was searching for Thompson, found him in a crawl space in the basement. Police ran a background check on him and discovered that he was arrested",
        "BREAKING: Barack Obama just secretly fled the U.S. after Donald Trump found some disturbing criminal evidence he left behind in the Oval Office. This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won\u2019t soon forget!Mad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn\u2019t cover their tracks well enough.The members of Obama\u2019s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the \u201cPresidential Daily Briefings\u201d (PDB).\u201cDuring the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the \u2018small group\u2019 collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,\u201d reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama\u2019s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.\u201cNunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was \u2018not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.\u2019 So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,\u201d reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn\u2019t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called \u201cNational Security Action,\u201d who says their mission is, \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America\u2019s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.\u201dThese people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it. Unfortunately for them, however, McCabe\u2019s firing makes it clear that they won\u2019t get away with this act of treason.What do you think about this?

        "Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government. In the past two weeks, after receiving a...\u201cNOS\u201d stands for \u201cNovus Ordo Seclorum,\u201d or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama\u2019s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It\u2019s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama\u2019s \u201cteam\u201d has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation\u2019s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place \u2014 along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC \u2014 is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama\u2019s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren\u2019t your friends. Get out of the house and don\u2019t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.",

        "Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian AgentsAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds \u2014 literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name \u201cAlexi Jonesinov\u201d) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.\u201cWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,\u201d one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people\u2019s actions as \u201cRussian neuro-brain hacking.\u201dWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cgoofy.\u201d However, Peskov suspiciously asked \u201cvere is Moose and Squirrel?\u201dNSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people\u2019s brains, he\u2019s \u201cnever seen anything on this scale before.\u201dThe Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts\u2026almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don\u2019t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven\u2019t noticed, Trump\u2019s people have most of the guns.",
        "804 SHARES Share TweetAnd once again the mainstream media ends up with egg on its face. This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.As the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.Witness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a gun on me but wish I did\u201d pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa \u2014 \u13e2\u13d2\u13a5s\u13df\u13a5\u13de\u13de\u13aa\u2019s \u13c9\u13a5\u13ac\u13b3 \u2122\ufe0f (@PriscillasView) April 3, 2018\u201cWhen asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, \u201cI knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.\u201dThe witness also added, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.\u201dHe said he wished he had a gun. And that\u2019s the way he should feel. And that\u2019s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm. And no, they didn\u2019t just mean muskets like you liberals keep trying to tell us. \u2018Wow.. they will run this poor man out of looney California! \u2014 al_waisman (@al_waisman) April 4, 2018Reports are confirming that this particular shooting was just a disgruntled woman who wanted to kill her boyfriend, which would potentially make the event a case of domestic violence. And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.California is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50\u2019s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.I am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms\u2026 they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that\u2019s all.The shooter has now been identified via ABC 30SAN BRUNO, Calif. \u2014 Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.Aghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.Sources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.According to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.Police and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.She embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube \u201cAd-apocalypse\u201d where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.Neistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.It appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform.

        "8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president\u2019s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the \u201charm\u201d he claims. The \u201cBe careful what you wish for Max!\u201d quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps \u201cthe Second Amendment people\u201d i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump\u2019s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president\u2019s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd \u201cfaces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\u201dLloyd\u2019s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters\u2019 Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:\u201cIf you continue to make threats towards the president, you\u2019re going to wind up dead, Maxine, \u2019cause we\u2019ll kill you.\u201cThe voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump\u2019s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump\u2019s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn\u2019t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don\u2019t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their \u201cBed Rest Studies\u201d, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I\u2019d had enough, I\u2019d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.You wouldn\u2019t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!As long as they remain laying down. You\u2019re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.NASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.NASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:Understanding how one\u2019s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.Understanding the impact of one\u2019s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The experiment will consist of two categories.The exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body\u2019s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.",

He does so for the sole intent of lining his own pockets at the expense of others.George Soros now lives in the United States and has been involved in many of the anti-Trump protests around the country. He has paid salaries and housing for many of the leaders of Black Lives Matters group, in addition to paying young people to protest Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the U.S.He has done this before in different countries throughout Europe and Asia. Basically, he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one.Russia was once a victim of his demented financial upheaval. Back in the \u201890\u2019s he wrote a letter that besmirched the Russian currency and said it was overvalued. Investors immediately panicked and dumped the Russian currency. The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets.Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros. Although it took years, Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin officially issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros for his role in collapsing Russia\u2019s currency and the resulting financial meltdown.Now, as an American citizen, it is a bit tricky to remove him, but when Trump takes office, it may completely change.

Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a \u201cmini Baghdad,\u201d but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another \u201caccomplishment\u201d on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the \u201clargest scam in United States history.\u201dMuslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation\u2019s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation\u2019s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the \u201clargest scam\u201d that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:\u201cOfficials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam\u2019s value.\u2018Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,\u2019 Sessions said.A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.\u201dThe ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers\u2019 noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here\u2019s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet\u2026all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid\u2019s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in De",

The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.\u2018As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD\u2019s request for information about this \u201cevent\u201d, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion\u2013 Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73\u2014with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database \u201ctarget hit\u201d on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a \u201cprobable witness\u201d against the Clinton Foundation.,\u2018Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey\u2014and whose inclusion in the SVR\u2019s database of \u201cpotential witnesses\u201d against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a \u201ccentral identified and named figure\u201d in the creation of a document titled \u201cTraining Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine\u201d for the New Jersey Department of Education.\u2019\u2018Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis\u2014that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death\u2014and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)\u2014and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its \u201cemergency administration\u201d led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it\u2014and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.\u2019\u2018Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a \u201cmain target\u201d person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history\u2014that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation\u2014and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education\u2014and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions\u2014that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses\u2019 offices throughout the United States\u2014with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools\u2014and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their \u201cEpiPen Law\u201d that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.\u2019\u2018Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch\u2014who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens\u2014became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.\u2014with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million\u2014and whose \u201cprotection\u201d for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin\u2019s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.\u2019\u2018To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her \u201cactive and knowing\u201d participation in the United States opioid crisis\u2014that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year\u2014nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma\u2014who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a \u201cblind eye\u201d to their flooding of America with opioids\u2014and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin\u2019s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.\u2019\u2018This report, after describing the",
        "President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he\u2019s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here\u2019s what WJ just reported:\u201cThe staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the \u2018Questionnaire for National Security Positions.\u2019 The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant\u2019s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.\u201dThe six staffers included the daughter of President Trump\u2019s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:\u201cWiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.\u201dThe form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It\u2019s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:\u201cDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be \u2018their most sacred obligation.\u2019 Schiff added, referring to Trump: \u2018I\u2019m sure there are people in the community who feel they don\u2019t know where he\u2019s coming from on Russia.'\u201dJust as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",

        "In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America\u2019s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)\u201cMy audience likes Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.\u201dSome of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that \u201cthe Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.\u201d Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: \u201cStop it Liberals\u2026Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here\u2019s Why.\u201d That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people\u2019s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)",

        "George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump\u2019s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.During his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.The harsh rhetoric of Trump\u2019s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it \u201csome weird s--t\u201d and Jimmy Carter saying he \u201cflinched\u201d when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump\u2019s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the \u201cunwritten rule\u201d that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.\u201cThe immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,\u201d George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. \u201cThis kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it\u2019s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president\u2026 is pretty unusual.\u201dAs Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he\u2019s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was \u201cheartened\u201d by the protests following Trump\u2019s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump\u2019s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. \u201cI expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,\u201d Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama\u2019s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump\u2019s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn\u2019s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn\u2019s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. \u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,\u201d Bush said in an interview with \u201cToday\u201d in February. \u201cWe need an independent media to hold people like me to account.\u201dAs for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. \u201cI am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,\u201d Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump\u2019s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women\u2019s movement would be \u201cinvigorated\u201d by Trump and that he didn\u2019t see \u201cany glimmer of hope\u201d from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman\u2019s presidential campaign, didn\u2019t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know much,\u201d Clinton said in late December. \u201cOne thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.\u201dGeorge H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that\u2019s not really unprecedented,\u201d Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. \u201cIf it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.\u201dCurrent and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.\u201dThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.\u201cMost of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,\u201d Mack McLarty, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, said.For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.\u201cWhat would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cIf we see that none of the former presidents want",

Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement \u201cFor survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting\u201d using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.Dammegard\u2019s source received the following email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department and forwarded it to Dammegard:Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018.

        "UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking \u201cout of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,\u201d according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a \u201csanctuary county\u201d in May 2014. The county only cooperates with \u201cICE holds\u201d if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department\u2019s \u201c1.0 Policy Statement\u201d reads: \u201cNo person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.\u201d The policy adds that \u201cthe immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff\u2019s Office personnel execute their duties.\u201dAccording to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated \u2014 about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.",

        "Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as \u2013 Enya\u2019s \u2018Who Can Say\u2019.After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home\u2019s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement\u2019s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group\u2019s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:\u201cI find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don\u2019t, so I stick to what works for me\u201d.Upon searching the home\u2019s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift \u2018tool wall\u2019 that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.\u201cThough modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201dProvost\u2019s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer\u2019s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are current",

        "Update:The Syrian Arab Red Crescent statement was reported, and at the time we had no reason to believe it was not true. Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.\u2014The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn\u2019t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might\u2019ve been exposed to.(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)Chemical attack or no, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn\u2019t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these \u201creal\u201d patients to confirm an attack.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",
        "Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted networkUPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump.During a Fox news segment in which Republican strategist Frank Luntz thought the media should give Trump more credit for the nation's economic \"clear recovery,\" someone behind the scenes made a boo boo.When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll \u2013 one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News.Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy.Kurtz quickly said, \"This is not the graphic we're looking for \u2013 hold off.

        "Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning, in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario.The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the \u201cBattle of the St. Lawrence\u201d. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.\u201cWe have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,\u201d Professor Carpenter told reporters. \u201cThis could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported \u201cBattle of Niagara Falls\u201d which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.\u201dThe restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.",

        "Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He\u2019s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he\u2019s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. \u201cMy question is pretty straightforward,\u201d Kline told Price. \u201cWhy do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?\u201d Price\u2019s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. \u201cI took care of a lot of patients with cancer,\u201d Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.\u201d\u201cBut, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you\u2019re doing here, because you\u2019re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?\u201d Kline wouldn\u2019t back down. \u201cAre you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?\u201d Price thought for a second, then replied: \u201cLook, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone\u2019s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me \u2013 I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.\u201dHe continued, \u201cI understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who\u2019ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he\u2019s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I\u2019m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we\u2019re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.\u201d\u201cPut simply, we have to plug some holes \u2013 of which, by the way, there are plenty \u2013 and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,\u201d the orthopedic surgeon added. \u201cUnfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it\u2019s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer \u2013 I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about, Brian \u2013 they can\u2019t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?\u201d\u201cAt the risk of sounding insensitive, we\u2019ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it\u2019s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it\u2019s a lousy way to live anyway, and I\u2019m sorry to say it out loud, but it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Price concluded.",

        "Muslim convert and would-be domestic terrorist Everitt Aaron Jameson, who planned to carry out a Christmas Day massacre on Pier 39 in San Francisco, was a supporter of Antifa and counted amongst his favourite news organisations CNN, BuzzFeed and Al-Jazeera.The former US Marine was arrested after he told the FBI of his plan to carry out the atrocity, noting that December 25 would be \u201cthe perfect day to commit the attack\u201d because Pier 39 would be crowded with people.Media reports confirmed that Jameson \u201chad recently been posting and liking pro-terrorism content on Facebook\u201d and had expressed support for the ISIS-inspired Halloween truck attack in New York. He converted to Islam two years ago.However, what those reports don\u2019t mention is that the would-be terrorist also \u2018liked\u2019 numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including \u2018Trump Resistance Movement\u2019, \u2018Things Trump Supporters Say\u2019, \u2018US Democratic Socialists\u2019, \u2018Progressive Politics\u2019, and \u2018Jeremy Corbyn\u2019.Some of Jameson\u2019s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera.

        "26.6k SHARES Share TweetIt turns out that our moon isn\u2019t alone out there, orbiting our planet on its own. Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.The new moon isn\u2019t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.The smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon\u2019s orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet\u2019s \u2018original\u2019 moon.The \u2018new\u2019 moon is tilted at around 8\u00b0 and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.The orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth\u2019s smaller moon for coming centuries.The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.\u201cSince 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,\u201d said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \u201cOne other asteroid \u2014 2003 YN107 \u2014 followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth\u2019s companion for centuries to come.\u201dSourceLike this: Like Loading...",
        "Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she\u2019s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle\u2019s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone\u2019s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she\u2019d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle\u2019s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that\u2019s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama\u2019s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband\u2019s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, \u201cOn Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.\u201dWright diagnosed Mrs. Obama\u2019s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.\u201cShe\u2019s in legacy building mode. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis is the time she\u2019s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.\u201dAs First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.\u201cI think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that\u2019s been true over the last three administrations,\u201d she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she\u2019s now suffering a feeling of \u201chopelessness\u201d with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It\u2019s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America\u2019s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our coun",

        "Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and Russia\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he\u2019s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump\u2019s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI\u2019s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok\u2019s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok \u201cintends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.\u201dThe letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with \u201cspecific investigative decisions,\u201d but said that comment and others \u201cimplies a willingness to take official action.\u201dStrzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn\u2019t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump\u2019s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there\u2019s \u201cno question\u201d that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that \u201cI think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.\u201dMueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent \u201cintends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that\u2019s a topic, and his own integrity.\u201dTrump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general\u2019s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump\u2019s allies from calling for Mueller\u2019s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI\u2019s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump from becoming President?

We know the game and we're gonna play it,\" said Trump.Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's \"commitment\" should have not just been limited to Facebook. \"You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,\" Rowlinson said. \"You wouldn't get this from any other guy,\" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.Donald Trump's remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

        "It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she\u2019s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby\u2019s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn\u2019t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.",
        "Lisa Page, former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship.According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed \u2018assets\u2019 had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s 30,000+ \u201cmissing\u201d emails, federal sources said.The Russians didn\u2019t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America\u2019s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary\u2019s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude \u2014 publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary\u2019s sensitive and top secret emails \u2014 would have derailed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn\u2019t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton\u2019s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary\u2019s emails? The FBI didn\u2019t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president\u2019s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server \u2014 and intercepted by a communist country \u2014 yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton\u2019s and her inner circle\u2019s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI \u2014 specifically Strzok \u2014 about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?",

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer\u2019s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.Once again, we\u2019re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won\u2019t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties.

        "The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised \u201cfull implementation\u201d of the UN\u2019s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue\u2026 perhaps they don\u2019t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN\u2019s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American \u2018representatives\u2019 at the conference agreed to begin developing \u2018legal frameworks\u2019 (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce \u201cproper management\u201d of \u201csmall arms and light weapons\u201d stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes \u2018stockpiles\u2019 owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find \u2018illicit\u2019 ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN\u2019s history of pushing for gun control measures, it\u2019s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN\u2019s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The \u2018Programme of Action\u2019 also allows UN \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 to go to member nations to \u2018assist\u2019 in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to \u2018help\u2019 speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen \u2018coordinated approaches\u2019 nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a \u2018national point of contact\u2019 to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to \u2018make better use\u2019 of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be \u2018in compliance\u2019 with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and \u2018non-proliferation,\u2019 which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to \u2018significantly reduce\u2019 illicit flows of small arms through means such as \u2018voluntary surrender\u2019 programmes and \u2018illicit weapons\u2019 recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don\u2019t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the",
        "The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.\u201cThis is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,\u201d liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama\u2019s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.\u201cICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,\u201d Fallon tweeted. \u201cDems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.\u201dThomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.\u201cThese politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,\u201d Homan said Thursday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201dBut the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.\u201cICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,\u201d Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. \u201cBut let\u2019s not abuse the power.\u201dSince then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.\u201cKamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,\u201d Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. \u201cIt should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.\u201dHe added: \u201cShe should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.\u201dMirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- \u201cshould be asked the same question.\u201dPELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS \u2018UNJUST AND CRUEL\u2019The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Abolish ICE.\u201d The writer accused the agency of being part of an \u201cunbridled white-supremacist surveillance state\u201d and called it \u201can unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\u201cThough the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it\u2019s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,\u201d McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as \"unjust and cruel.\"Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff\u2019s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR \u2018RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA\u2019Sessions called California\u2019s \"open borders\" policies a \u201cradical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.\u201d\u201cIt cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can this be a sound polic",

Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated.The elite do not vaccinateIn California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study.The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. That\u2019s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.\u201cVery rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don\u2019t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children.

        "A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the \u201cbest way to help Israel\u201d.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton\u2019s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government\u2014and specifically to do this because it is in Israel\u2019s interests.\u201cThe best way to help Israel deal with Iran\u2019s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,\u201d Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran\u2019s \u201catom bomb\u201d program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to \u201cjustify\u201d destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran\u2019s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran\u2019s \u201catom bomb\u201d program threatens Israel\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other \u201cadversaries of Israel\u201d such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to \u201cgo nuclear as well,\u201d all of which would threaten Israel\u2019s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran\u2019s nuclear program and Syria\u2019s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about \u2014 but cannot talk about \u2014 is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the \u201cstrategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria\u201d that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel\u2019s security.This would not come about through a \u201cdirect attack,\u201d Clinton admits, because \u201cin the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel\u201d this has never occurred, but through its alleged \u201cproxies.\u201dThe end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel\u2019s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel\u2019s security, it would also ease Israel\u2019s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad \u201cand his family\u201d with violence is the \u201cright thing\u201d to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u2019s mind.The email prov",

While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year\u2019s flu \u2013 which may continue to affect Americans into April \u2013 we\u2019re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season\u2019s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we\u2019re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year\u2019s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we\u2019ve learned so far about this season\u2019s vaccines and the steps we\u2019re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year\u2019s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season\u2019s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We\u2019re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn\u2019t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season\u2019s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don\u2019t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season\u2019s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year\u2019s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we\u2019re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season\u2019s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.Working to determine the root causesToward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We\u2019re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system\u2019s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We\u2019re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season\u2019s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season\u2019s vaccines should be produced.Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu seasonWhile this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season\u2019s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee",
        "The guest list hasn\u2019t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,\u201d adding that invitations \u201cwill be announced in due course.\u201dMark Blinch/ReutersWhen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn\u2019t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry\u2019s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump\u2019s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a \u201cworking trip\u201d where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go \u201cone better\u201d than Obama\u2019s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowRead more: Melania Trump \u201cwent bananas\u201d when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry.

The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan.

        "Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she\u2019s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn\u2019t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore \u201cgroped her in the alley behind the\u201d church they both attended in 1957. \u201cIt was the most horrifying moment of my life,\u201d she told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. \u201cRoy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,\u201d she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif\u2019s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn\u2019t say anything until he was running for Senator because they \u201cfeared for their lives.\u201d Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion \u201cshe\u201d and her \u201chusband\u201d Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit\u2019s Charles C.

        "A dispute in Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader\u2019s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor\u2019s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel\u2019s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent\u2019s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That\u2019s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel\u2019s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it\u2019s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn\u2019t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party\u2019s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It\u2019s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany\u2019s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar",

        "Seth Rich Seth Rich- EDITOR'S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:FOX 5 DC: \u201cYou have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...\u201dWHEELER: \"For sure...\"FOX 5 DC: \u201c...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?\"WHEELER: \"Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as \"miscommunication.\"When asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.We reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, \"The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original story:It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that \"the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.\u201dWhen we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, \u201cAbsolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"Wheeler also told us, \"I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, \u2018Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can\u2019t share any information with you.\u2019 Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don\u2019t think it comes from the chief\u2019s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].Wheeler told FOX 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.FOX 5's Melanie Alnwick spoke with D.C. Police on Tuesday and was told that Wheeler\u2019s assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the Rich case was false.The family sent Alnwick a statement on Tuesday with the following statement:\"As we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.

        "Maxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant. She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor.

She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!Sources: Teddy Stick \u2013 1tch",
        "Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump\u2019s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, \u201cSolyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.\u201dOur Secret Service source supports that contention.\u201cObama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn\u2019t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama\u2019s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don\u2019t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I\u2019m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,\u201d our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)",
        "CNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May.While Fox News increased its total viewers by a healthy 6 percent and MSNBC held steady, CNN\u2019s viewership took a nosedive, signalling that the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNN\u2019s relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channel\u2019s ratings crisis is even more severe.CNN lies.Numbers do not\u2026Last week, during the all-important primetime hours, CNN was only able to average 844K total viewers. During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN\u2019s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN\u2019s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN\u2019s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN\u2019s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC\u2019s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.The bottom line is that CNN\u2019s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.",
        "Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman\u2019s life or preventing the \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\u201cAt the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,\u201d Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. \u201cWomen are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.\u201dHe continued, \u201cOur mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there\u2019s one very simple reason why I did it. That\u2019s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they\u2019re supposed to be closed, if she doesn\u2019t have the foresight to make sure she doesn\u2019t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.\u201d\u201cA woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we\u2019re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child \u2013 a being who\u2019s done no wrong and only exists as its mother\u2019s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you another thing \u2013 as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn\u2019t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,\u201d the governor concluded.",

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.\u201d he admits, visibly puzzled. \u201cIt is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,\u201d he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region\u2019s waters \u201cis highly unlikely\u201d as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.",

        "Beijing | Top officials of the Chinese Space Program have come out this morning and expressed their feelings that the American moon landings \u201cwere a complete hoax\u201d reports the Beijing Daily Express.200 high-ranking officials from the Chinese Space Program have signed a petition asking explanations from the American government and the release of classified NASA information concerning the American moon landings that would prove to the World that the moon landings were not an elaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the World about America\u2019s space program capabilities.These allegations have come up through recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese moon rover that allegedly found no traces of the American moon landings existing on the moon.World renowned Russian nuclear engineer Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin has also signed the petition as well as a dozen other top Russian engineers and ex-KGB agents claiming the Russian Government \u201chad always been aware of the situation since the early 1970\u2019s\u201dThese recent discoveries could strangely give credence to conspiracy theorists whom have claimed for decades that America had never gone to the moon but that the American moon landings were but an elaborate hoax to foul Russia into the space race and eventually, the nuclear arms race, with the purpose of ruining Russia, much like the financing of the Mujahideen forces during the Soviet Afghanistan war successfully achieved.",
        "BREAKING: Meryl Streep Just Got Fired From A Major Project For Lying About TrumpAfter saying 6 minutes of mean things about Donald Trump without ever once using his name, humiliating him in front of a crowd of Hollywood elites and millions watching around the world, Meryl Streep got word From Ron Howard that she was no longer being cast as an older, wiser version of Mrs. C in a reboot of Happy Days that was to make her millions.Streep was to team up with Otis Winslow of \u201cFamily Matters\u201d so Happy Days could be written into this century, with multi-racial families, gender identity and the gays playing a role in the plotlines. Ron Howard was to take on the role of Richie Cunningham once again, and other original actors include the guys who play Potsie and Malph, a cameo by Henry Winkler while Jon Voight plays Fonzie and an attractive guy who isn\u2019t worth less than the chick from Charles In Charge plays Chachi, who now loves a guy named Jeff. Scot Baio had to be ejected from auditions when he found out he didn\u2019t get the part.Now the project is on hold as the other person cast perfectly for the role was Florence Henderson, who passed away recently, but producers are hoping to fill the gap with Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond.Meryl Streep, who hasn\u2019t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes, is said to be almost broke and that the millions from this project were to basically cover her retirement. The date for that has been moved up now that she\u2019s been deemed overrated by Trump and irrelevant to most Trump supporters, which basically covers the known world and the leader of it.Comments",
        "It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. \"You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, \"Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of \u2018convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen\u2019s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.",

An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense.

After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and \u201chigh ranking sanctioned individuals\u201d in Moscow over the summer as evidence of \u201csignificant and disturbing ties\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.Some of those briefed were \u201ctaken aback\u201d when they learned about Page\u2019s contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.

Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.Ms. McCrummen\u2019s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona\u2019s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction.

        "The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can\u2019t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that \u201cabortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.\u201d \u201cSo, let\u2019s get that straight right away \u2013 I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn\u2019t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we\u2019re murderers of innocent beings who can\u2019t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?\u201d the Indiana governor said.\u201cAnd as if that wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Pence continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that\u2019s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost \u2013 we can\u2019t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let\u2019s be clear. And that\u2019s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I\u2019m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.\u201dPence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. \u201cFirst and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We\u2019d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.\u201dDonald Trump\u2019s new running mate also said, \u201cBasically, if I\u2019d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they\u2019d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it\u2019s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher\u2019s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I\u2019m not a murderer.\u201d\u201cAnd it gets worse \u2013 when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana\u2019s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I\u2019m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,\u201d Pence concluded.",

After a thorough examination, blood tests and scans the young boy tested favorable for the HIV virus. His mother certainly in shock. However, the 10-year-old child was not the only one admitted to the medical facility for the very same concern. Eight kids, all under the age of 17, have actually been identified as HIV-positive within the month of March. Exactly what is the something they share? Getting bananas from The Tulsa, Oklahoma Walmart.In accordance with the moms and dads, they sent several foods their kids had been consuming to medical professionals for screening, along with documenting the different places they had visited within the month. They discovered that 8 children had consumed bananas from the superstore. The facility, LHC Laboratories, evaluated the bananas which all came up positive consisting of the HIV virus. Scientists are still attempting to understand how the infection might have gotten in the bananas, remained active, and contaminated the kids through consumption.In the meantime, bananas are being managed the racks in Walmart stores across the United States. According to many media outlets, the CDC is motivating Americans to discard any leftover bananas and to call your doctor if you experience any of the following signs:FeverChillsRashNight sweatsMuscle achesAching throatTirednessInflamed lymph nodesMouth soresThese signs might be an indication that you have actually contracted the HIV virus and have to look for medical attention immediately.",

        "San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz\u2019s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president \u2014 and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the \u201cblame Trump\u201d narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA\u2019s actions.\u201cWhat is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,\u201d Yul\u00edn Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled \u201cNASTY\u201d \u2014 where did she get it during a major storm? \u2014 as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. \u201cWe are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,\u201d she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of \u201cinefficiency and bureaucracy\u201d in Puerto Rico \u2026 but it looks like the island\u2019s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.\u201cThe suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,\u201d the AP reported.\u201cU.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town\u2019s public employees and municipal contractors,\u201d the newswire continued.\u201cNot only is that illegal, it\u2019s immoral,\u201d Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz V\u00e9lez, who served as mayor. Ortiz V\u00e9lez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.\u201cRodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,\u201d the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it\u2019s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn\u2019t point to Donald Trump \u2026 it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.",
        "Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA\u2019s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.\u201cI have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA\u2019s payroll,\u201d claims Edward Snowden. \u201cHe is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.\u201dMr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.\u201cOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIA\u2019s most efficient operatives for a long time,\u201d claims the famous whistleblower. \u201cWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody\u2019s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.\u201dMr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a \u201cWe the People\u201d petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.",
        "The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States\u2026THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:\u2018DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!\u2019 The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York\u2019s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about \u2018attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,\u2019\u201cHe said further that he would \u2018continue to create chaos\u2019 for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.\u201dDonald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It\u2019s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world\u2019s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is \u2018very interested in communications,\u2019 which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him \u2018a real-estate genius\u2019 who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970\u2019s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. \u2018With manufacturing leaving,\u2019 says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, \u2018and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.\u2019The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump\u2019s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.\u2018He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,\u2019 a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren\u2019t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: \u2018If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.\u2019 Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.\u2018He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,\u2019 says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. \u2018I don\u2019t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,\u2019 he says, \u2018but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: \u2018Tell us what you want, you\u2019re going to get it anyway.\u2019\u2018Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,\u2019 says a developer\u2026 He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.\u2019Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s friend and attorney, adds: \u2018He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.\u2019Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970\u2019s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son\u2019s efforts to buy the hotel as \u2018fighting for a seat on the Titanic.\u2019 But, Donald Trump says, \u2018I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, \u2018How bad can this be?\u201d He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. \u2018If the seller was Italian,\u2019 says Mr. Trump, \u2018we sent an Italian\u2019 \u2013 something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.\u2018It\u2019s in his genes,\u2019 says Fred Trump, explaining his son\u2019s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.\u2018Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,\u2019 says Mr. Fischer. \u2018We\u2019ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.\u2019His success also derives from his marketing skills. \u2018I want to bring a",

        "For the mainstream media to say that illegal immigration isn\u2019t an issue they really need to look at the world around them and see how things really are out there.For decades there have been people that came to the United States illegally, but it\u2019s only in the past year or so that it seems that people have been doing it just to spite the system.People don\u2019t mass organize like this without someone leading the charge.Currently, ahead of all other candidates, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will likely be the next President of Mexico.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as \u201cAMLO,\u201d has been openly telling his people to flood the U.S. border. What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise\u2026He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.AMLO\u2019s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico\u2019s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.Reported by 100percentfedup: Well\u2026at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what\u2019s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades.

So, AMLO\u2019s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More",
        "Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, \u201cIn loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem\u2019s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y\u2019all.\u201dRelated: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich\u2019s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, \u201cThose who have suggested that Seth\u2019s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.\u201dSAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile\u2019s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich\u2019s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.\u201dBrazile had spoken publicly about Rich\u2019s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, \u201cSeth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth\u2019s legacy to his country and party is shameful.\u201d About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, \u201cSeth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.\u201dThrough spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, \u201cSince Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family\u2019s efforts to find Seth\u2019s killers.\u201dIn the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters seemed \u201cantiseptic, like a hospital,\u201d and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a \u201cslave.\u201d In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile\u2019s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, \u201cIt is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate\u2019s health.\u201dBrazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member.

        "Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedInGretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15. Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to \u201chunt or kill deer\u201d and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban and said, \u201cI\u2019m with the majority today, taking a stand.\u201dInterestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that \u201cthe fact that you\u2019re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you\u2019re ignorant. Don\u2019t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?\u201dAsked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that \u201cat one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don\u2019t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who\u2019s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google \u2018the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?\u2019 I mean, really.\u201d\u201cAnd what worried me even more,\u201d she continued, \u201cwas the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I\u2019m sitting there, thinking, \u2018Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn\u2019t paying attention during history class \u2013 a lot of someones, apparently \u2013 hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.\u2019\u201dCarlson also added, \u201cI mean, I know the education in our country isn\u2019t the best in the world, but I figured we\u2019d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What\u2019s the next thing I\u2019m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I\u2019m not buying it.\u201d\u201cLike, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don\u2019t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something.

        "(Jim Lo Scalzo for USN&WR)1. One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth\u2014as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five\u2014Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years\u2014and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life\u2014including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California\u2014Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a \"new Democrat\" nor an \"old Democrat\" but a \"prehistoric Democrat.\" Other Republicans call her a \"latte Democrat\" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat\u2013around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics. To practice her penmanship, \"Little Nancy\" was in charge of the book in which her New Deal father kept track of favors done and owed.10. A true San Franciscan, Pelosi makes sure that her office is stocked with Ghirardelli chocolates. Her diet typically consists of mostly chocolate and chocolate ice cream. Completing the notoriously challenging New York Times crossword puzzle is one of her favorite hobbies.Sources:www.house.govwww.notablebiographies.comTimeThe GuardianThe EconomistThe New York TimesThe Financial Times",

Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual.However, due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society, it is expected that the actual percentage of homosexual black men in Atlanta is much larger.\u200bReactions to the study included both joy and fear as both men and women across the country expressed happiness in the openness of the men surveyed or fear of the \u201crising number of gays,\u201d says Rednecks Against Being Homo chairwoman Natasha Tarwater.\u200bBDSM enthusiast Reginald Monroe of Atlanta, while walking his leather-clad male slave through downtown, said,",

        "(CNN) First lady Melania Trump underwent kidney surgery Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington, DC, according to a statement from her office.Trump had been experiencing an issue with her kidney that her office described as benign but requiring medical attention.\"This morning, first lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful, and there were no complications,\" the first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement.\"Mrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere,\" Grisham wrote.President Donald Trump remained in the White House during Melania Trump's surgery. He tweeted just after 5 p.m. Monday that he was heading to hospital to visit his wife in Marine One.\"Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!\" Trump tweeted.Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018Trump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning.She is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of \"Scandal.\"On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best . She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady.Be Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media. The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trump's husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling. In March, the first lady addressed the criticism she has faced by taking up the issue during opening remarks to a meeting she convened at the White House for tech industry leaders from Google, Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others.JUST WATCHED Melania Trump's popularity jumps in new poll Replay More Videos ...

        "WITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London\u2019s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. \u201cWe do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,\u201d Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:\u201cThe new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.\u201d\u201cIt means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.\u201dMillions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don\u2019t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:\u201cThere is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists \u2013 and even \u201cmoderate\u201d Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.\u201dYes, that\u2019s right\u2014because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow \u201cintolerant.\u201d Well do you know what most Americans think?You\u2019re damn right it\u2019s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500\u2019s AD? We shouldn\u2019t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is \u201cunfair,\u201d and \u201cdiscriminates,\u201d against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there\u20146th safest in the world, to be exact.\u201cAlthough Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.\u201dAfter the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.",

        "Living in regular-sized homes with plenty of space for closets, lockers and shelves gives us little need to think about storage space. In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn\u2019t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can\u2019t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn\u2019t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don\u2019t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn\u2019t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can\u2019t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers."

        "2.4k SHARES Share TweetPhotos of arrested illegal immigrants from cage-like cells moved viral this weekend. Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump\u2019s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they\u2019re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president\u2019s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump\u2019s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They\u2019ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn\u2019t hesitate to question his children\u2019s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals \u2014 arrested by our government \u2014 were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,\u201dFirst glance of immigrant kids at holding facility\u201d and said\u201dThis is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible\u201dHis obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let\u2019s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That\u2019s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama\u2019s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren\u2019t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn\u2019t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members\u201danimals,\u201d Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama\u2019s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump\u2019s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...",

        "During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to \u201cquiet that annoying ass baby down.\u201dAfter the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother\u2019s arms and slapping him in the face.

        "Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.Have this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.The true explanation is much less exciting.Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state\u2019s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.",

        "One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri\u2019s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team\u2019s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., \u201cDid you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?\u201d she answered: \u201cNot to my knowledge. I didn\u2019t see him with it.\u201dThe question was then asked, \u201cAnd as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera \u2013 with a camera or a phone?\u201dK.S. replied, \u201cCorrect.\u201dThe counsel then asked, \u201cAnd you can\u2019t say you saw it on his person, you can\u2019t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?\u201dK.S. answered, \u201cYes. I cannot say.\u201dTrying to salvage the state\u2019s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., \u201cDid you see what you believed to be a phone?\u201dHere comes the shocker. K.S. answered, \u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t talked about it because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m remembering it through a dream or I \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven\u2019t spoken about it because of that.\u201dK.S. remembered the photo incident \u201cthrough a dream\u201d? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.\u2019s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.",
        "It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, \u201cincluding thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama\u2019s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges\u2013 no trial\u2013just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 \u2014 teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught \u2014 and he wanted to attack this loophole. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?\u201d Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents\u2019 knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held \u2014 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don\u2019t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in \u201cfacilities\u201d so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.\u201cOur concern is that the program\u2019s real intent is to interrogate the kids,\u201d said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are \u201coften questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.\u201d While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer\u2019s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative\u2019s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico\u201cThe moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn\u2019t an announcement,\u201d said Reyna Torres Mend\u00edvil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry\u2019s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. \u201cWhere were they taking these children?\u201dRegarding prevent",

        "Denzel\u2019s recent comments about the \u201cOrwellian Police State\u201d is so very apparent, given the FBI, DNC, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama scandal inside the administration\u2019s treasonous activity in having the Clinton Foundation pay for a fake dossier, made by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, which they hoped would create false allegations which would concede Donald Trump\u2019s Presidential victory. This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller\u2019s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, \u201cIf the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!\u201dDenzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film \u2018Roman J. Israel, Esq.\u2019 (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didn\u2019t pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: \u201cThey would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections\u201d.When a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was \u201creliable\u201d, he responded, \u201cHell yeah, it\u2019s reliable. We don\u2019t need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly what\u2019s happened here\u201d.\u201cWe know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.\u201d\u201cYou guys can\u2019t see what is wrong with this? You\u2019re kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign?\u201dDenzel Washington then later called out individual reporters and media outlets for never publishing anything negative about the Democrat Party, and subsequently hiding their scandals from any in-depth news output.Denzel continued, \u201cI grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you\u2019ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State\u201d.We couldn\u2019t agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didn\u2019t constitute complete treason?The double standards are \u201coh so\u201d apparent, and it\u2019s good to see somebody high up in celebrity circles like Denzel Washington to be brave enough speak out on these pressing issues, and helping to expose the scandals of the Democrat Party.",

        "Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person\u2019s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn\u2019t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.Fact-checking largely didn\u2019t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don\u2019t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. \"We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,\" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.CNN has also released a statement: \u201cThe RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.\u201d But that still doesn\u2019t really verify that anything occurred.@solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an \u2014 RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016@solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa \u2014 RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It\u2019s a layup for body-part puns.This is exactly how fake news spreadsBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it\u2019s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won\u2019t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.",

        "Share Us.A 78-year old retired officer of the CIA, Normand Hodges, has made a series of astonishing confessions. He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James \u201cJimmy\u201d Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the \u201cthe CIA had its own agenda\u201d. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists \u2013 all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant \u201cthreat to the security of the country\u201d and had to be eliminated.\u201cWe had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro\u201d, says M. Hodges. \u201cMy commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders\u2026 I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn\u2019t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!\u201dMarilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal \u2013 a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA\u2019s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren\u2019t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!",
        "How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?If they don\u2019t want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from. This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.Wouldn\u2019t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn\u2019t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they\u2019re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if \u201cwestern culture\u201d offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a \u201cdisputed view\u201d of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, \u201cRequiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of \u2018forced assimilation\u2019 of the Muslim community.\u201dHere\u2019s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can\u2019t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here\u2019s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We\u2019ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature\u2019s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history\u2019s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We\u2019ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who\u2019ve come across the seas We\u2019ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.Super oppressive lyrics, right?If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter\u2026it\u2019s really that simple.Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation\u2019s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It\u2019s their faith. The west doesn\u2019t get it because most liberals are faithless.It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don\u2019t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian\u2019s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn\u2019t pray\u2026 but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won\u2019t want to learn the country they have invaded history\u2026 because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?",

        "According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had \u201cno value\u201d and were \u201clike ISIS,\u201d and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 \u2014 $8,832.73 per month \u2014 according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera \u201chas a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as \u2018n*ggers'\u201d. One of Nucera\u2019s officers \u201cmade numerous recordings\u201d of Nucera that \u201ccontained extremely offensive racist comments\u201d over the course of a year because he was \u201calarmed\u201d by Nucera\u2019s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn\u2019t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police \u201cescalated into a physical struggle,\u201d that both teens \u201cresisted arrest\u201d and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old\u2019s head and slammed it \u201cinto the right side of the metal doorjamb,\u201d according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old\u2019s head make \u201ca loud thud\u201d as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn\u2019t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had \u201cstopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.\u201d The use of force wasn\u2019t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was \u201cf*cking tired\u201d of African-Americans.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cAnd that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,\u201d he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl\u2019s aunt, who was present at the arrest. \u201cFucking nipple hanging bitch. I\u2019m so tired of them, man.\u201dNucera allegedly said that black people should \u201cstay the fuck out of Bordentown\u201d and referred to the 18-year-old as \u201cfucking little, fucking n****r.\u201dIn a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to \u201cput my hands\u201d on him.\u201cThese n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cThey should line them all up and mow \u2019em down. I\u2019d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\u201cThe conduct alleged is shocking,\u201d acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.\u201cIt\u2019s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.\u201dAdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing.

        "Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin\u2019s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account \u2014 backed by documents \u2014 indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBill Clinton's novel sees fastest fiction sales in two years From Singapore, skepticism and hope The Memo: Summit gives Trump political boost \u2014 with risks MORE\u2019s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSessions defends firing Comey, warns DOJ report could prompt more terminations Sanders gets best reception at early 2020 audition Hillicon Valley: DHS gets new cyber chief | White House warns lawmakers not to block ZTE deal | White nationalists find home on Google Plus | Comcast outbids Disney for Fox | Anticipation builds for report on FBI Clinton probe MORE served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted \u201cwith the consent of higher level officials\u201d in Russia who \u201cshared the proceeds\u201d from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.ADVERTISEMENTRather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin\u2019s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton\u2019s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she \u201cnever intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.\u201dIn 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom\u2019s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.\u201cThe Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration\u2019s decision to approve Rosatom\u2019s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That\u2019s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee\u2019s decision that Vadim Mikerin \u2014 the main Russian overseeing Putin\u2019s nuclear expansion inside the United States \u2014 was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderHolder redistricting group backs lawsuits for 3 additional majority-black congressional districts Liberal groups launches ads against prospective Trump Supreme Court nominees Ready for somebody? Dems lack heir apparent this time MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn\u2019t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom\u2019s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom\u2019s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom\u2019s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin \u201cdid knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons \u2026 to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,\u201d a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin\u2019s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin",

        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department gifted an \u201cunknown number\u201d of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called \u201ccaregivers,\u201d according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government\u2019s handling of migrants.\u201cIt is intolerable that human trafficking \u2014 modern-day slavery \u2014 could occur in our own backyard,\u201d Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. \u201cBut what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.\u201dAs detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans \u2014 and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.The department performed check-in visits at caretakers\u2019 homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.The Senate\u2019s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.",
        "We all know that the recently passed tax bill is likely the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics. You know it, I know it, Paul Ryan knows it, Donald Trump knows it. Well, Trump probably doesn\u2019t, because, well, he\u2019s delusional.But it\u2019s really, really bad. And historically unpopular, like the President whose name will forever be attached to it.Maybe you aren\u2019t totally convinced about how bad it is yet. So there\u2019s this: Under this plan, a wealthy CEO can deduct a private jet, but a police officer cannot deduct his/her uniform.\u201cYeah, but they\u2019re the party of \u2018Blue Lives Matter\u2019 and thanking everyone who ever wore a uniform for anything for their service!\u201d you might say. And I have some oceanfront property in Idaho to sell you if you believe that.Salon reports, Donald Trump often declares his support, even love, for police, firefighters and other first responders. That isn\u2019t stopping him, however, from nicking their wallets in the new tax law that he is expected to sign in early January.Buried in the hastily drafted tax bill\u2019s more than 500 pages are provisions eliminating \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d deductions taken by almost 28 million taxpayers in 2015. Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.This year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.But that\u2019s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.Add police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer. And all to give the wealthiest among us more wealth.Shameful.",
        "President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.Trump told the crowd the following: \u201cPolice officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn\u2019t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.\u201dObama\u2019s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn\u2019t be offended. Apparently it\u2019s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm\u2019s way to save the innocent to be honored.President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods.

        "Greensburg clown found eating a live cat. Late last night Greensburg police received a phone call from a worried resident saying \"she heard very concerning sounds coming from an alley way near her house\". Upon arrival officers instantly heard the noise she was talking about but never expected what they where about to see. Upon investigation they found a 21 year old male dressed as a clown eating a live cat who's legs were zip tied together. The cat was still crying for help as the individual was seemingly eating around the vital spots prolonging it's death. When he noticed the officers he started petting the cat and told the officers \"curiosity killed the cat, I wanted to see if it tasted like Chinese food.\" He was non resistant during arrest however did not have identification when asked his name he always replied \"furball munchinsrein the clown\". In the holding cell it was reported he kept calling to a female officer \"here kitty kitty kitty\" she eventually approached him and said what he reportedly said \"I wonder if you taste like Chinese food come on just let me get one little bite\" and continued to bite at the cells bars. He is now in a high security prison for the criminally insane. It was reported that in the asylum he bit open his own fingers and painted himself as a clown with his own blood and refuses to answer questions and instead meows. His trial is on the 31st however police say they doubt he will ever be allowed back into society.",

        "The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews can\u2019t keep up with the calls that continue to pour in. President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it\u2019s time to take urgent action as he\u2019s announced in a shocking message to Americans.With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.\u201cFebruary\u2019s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,\u201d Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he\u2019s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build \u201ca great, great wall along our southern border\u201d \u2014 in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an \u201cunprecedented rate.\u201d \u201cOur terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,\u201d Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won\u2019t stop it completely, he\u2019s the first to address the epidemic that\u2019s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it\u2019s a step in the right direction and he\u2019s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

Violations would result in a fine of up to $100.\ue63f Facebook \ue640 Twitter \ue63a Pinterest \ue62f Google+ #2 Thousands Of Chemicals According to the Department of Health, when a child breathes in secondhand smoke, they breathe in thousands of chemicals, just like the smoker does. This puts them at risk of serious conditions including cancer, bronchitis, and pneumonia. And it can worsen asthma.\ue63f Facebook \ue640 Twitter \ue63a Pinterest \ue62f Google+ #3 All Private Vehicles The law applies to any private vehicle that is enclosed wholly or partly by a roof.

This comes as the federal agency Housing and Urban Development is rolling out its nationwide ban on smoking in public housing, and just a few years after many states have outlawed smoking in beaches and public parks. This trend raises the question: Are we getting closer to prohibiting tobacco smoking altogether? And would that be such a bad thing?\ue63f Facebook \ue640 Twitter \ue63a Pinterest \ue62f Google+ \u201cIn America, it\u2019s very difficult to be simply paternalistic,\u201d Ronald Bayer, co-director of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. American values of privacy and freedom make it very difficult to prohibit anything as mainstream as tobacco, even if it\u2019s to save the lives of smokers. That old \u201cnanny state\u201d argument rears its head every time. With millions of people still addicted to cigarettes, there is also the very real fear that a ban would spawn a black market similar to what exists with illegal drugs or what happened with alcohol during Prohibition.\ue63f Facebook \ue640 Twitter \ue63a Pinterest \ue62f Google+ 5. What's Next? Bayer suggests that one way to help people quit would be by tackling the problem from the supply side. \u201cI think we would do much better to think about reducing the nicotine content, so that the addictive quality of cigarettes wasn\u2019t as severe, and make quitting easier.\u201d The World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control established a method called MPOWER in 2008 that aims to end the \u201cglobal tobacco epidemic,\u201d which kills over 7 million people each year. The way to do this is not by banning it all at once, but instead by monitoring use and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke, offering ways to help people quit, warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.If you like this blog don't forget to share it.You are currently reading about Smoking In Cars With Children Is Illegal Starting January 30, 2018.

        "First Lady Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a complete exorcism, with \u201cpagan idols and demonic artifacts\u201d from \u201cthe Clinton and Obama years\u201d removed from the premises before she would set foot in the building, according to White House pastor Paul Begley.\u201cI\u2019m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,\u201d Melania Trump told Pastor Begley.\u201cThey cleansed the White House,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cThey had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.\u201dAfter the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left \u2013 a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.\u201cBecause apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,\u201d Begley said.The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, \u201c\u2018You\u2019ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests\u2018\u201d \u2013 she wanted respected Christian leaders \u2014 to go in and cleanse the White House or, \u2018I will not spend one night in it.\u2019\u201d\u201cI have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him\u2014seven times he\u2019s done this\u2014that is unheard of,\u201d Begley said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t ever \u2013 the guy\u2019s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.\u201dPastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged \u201cspirit arrived,\u201d possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is \u2013 an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, \u201cWith fingers crossed, the old rabbit\u2019s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .\u201dLater that year Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic \u201cspirit cooking\u201d dinner parties, featuring pig\u2019s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.With previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building.",

        "athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn\u2019t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she\u2019s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it\u2019s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say \u201ceeeeewwwwwww\u201d right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that\u2019s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here\u2019s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: \u201cThe event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump \u2014 which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year\u2019s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper \u2014 was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a \u201csideshow\u201d for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn\u2019t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine\u2019s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, \u201cdrunk.\u201dThe only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, \u201cHow do you sleep at night?\u201d Gidley replied, \u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, \u201cAre we really going to do this?\u201dThat\u2019s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, \u201cYes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!\u201dThere was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer \u201cbefore we build the wall and you can\u2019t get these anymore.\u201d That prompted a farewell \u201cf-ck you\u201d from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.\u201dIt sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn\u2019t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there\u2019s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they\u2019re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she",

        "The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, \u201cThis is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.\u201dAccording to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",

The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio\u2019s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. \u201cThe most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,\u201d Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to \u201cwhat\u2019s in our hearts.\u201d\u201cThe reality of it is, if you\u2019re a human living on this planet \u2014 which most of us are, yeah?\u201d she joked. \u201cAs long as we haven\u2019t signed up for the trip to Mars.

        "Pope Francis\u2019s latest controversial statement \u2013 that \u201cJesus is metaphorical, not literal\u201d \u2013 has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Francis\u2019s most controversial statements include:PREACHING THAT \u2018JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN\u2019Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of \u201cdebasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself\u201d, and \u201cturning into Satan.\u201dHardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it\u2019s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ \u201cmade himself the devil, the serpent, for us,\u201d according to L\u2019Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE \u2018HARMFUL\u2019The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that \u201ca personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ\u201d must be avoided at all costs.\u201cHaving a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,\u201d the pope said during the June 25 speech.The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.OPENLY CALLING FOR \u2018ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT\u2019In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has \u201ca distorted vision of the world\u201d and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, \u201cfor their own good.\u201dThe week before he also called for \u201ca one world government\u201d and \u201cpolitical authority\u201d, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as \u201cclimate change.\u201dSpeaking with Ecuador\u2019s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control \u201cfor the good of humanity.\u201dFrance\u2019s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a \u201cglobalist bulldog\u201c. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis\u2019s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis\u2019s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.Pope Francis\u2019s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question \u2013 is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?",

        "Televangelist Pat Robertson recently repeated his prediction that LGBT rights will provoke God to destroy America\u2019s financial markets, warning \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d viewers that God\u2019s wrath is on its way. He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has \u201censhrined sodomy into the United States Constitution\u201d and cities like Houston are trying to \u201cforce women to go into men\u2019s bathrooms and men to go into women\u2019s bathrooms.\u201d\u201cNow it\u2019s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,\u201d he lamented, warning that \u201cthe wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.\u201d He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it\u2019s a great country, I\u2019d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we\u2019re going to have this financial collapse. We\u2019re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that\u2019s probably the way he\u2019d do it.\u201dAt that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: \u201cI believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.\u201d\u201cI personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I\u2019m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,\u201d Robertson opined.The viewer then interrupted \u201cThe 700 Club\u201d host to state that \u201cthat sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,\u201d referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Robertson quickly became defensive. \u201cI am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?\u201d the host asked the caller.\u201cI do,\u201d the caller replied. \u201cBut I also understand that you\u2019re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago.

        "The FDA has published conclusive proof on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism.According to the FDA\u2019s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.What\u2019s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?According to the Tripedia\u2019s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.What is the content of these two growth mediums?Mueller and Miller medium, contains:Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (\u22640.3 \u03bcg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 \u03bcg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.\u201cProbable cause\u201d ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG\u2014an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.You might be wondering:Why some of the doctors don\u2019t say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine?That is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine.To take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults!It\u2019s time for Congress to rescind the \u201cGet out of Jail Free\u201d card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family.It\u2019s about time vaccines are publicl",

In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that\u2019s not what got him in trouble.After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:\u201cNo, man.

        "January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn\u2019s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa\u2019s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles \u2013 but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie\u2019s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride\u2019s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer\u2019s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.\u201cI remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you\u2019re seeing people for the last time,\u201d the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen\u2019s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride\u2019s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness \u2013 her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride\u2019s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:\u201cI was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t go back there. It\u2019s bad,\u2019\u201d Michael Tangney said. \u201cI opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.\u201dBut, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter\u2019s head in her hands. Katie\u2019s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie\u2019s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter\u2019s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder \u2013 though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer\u2019s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.\u201cSince no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,\u201d Jennifer said.\u201cI hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.\u201dThe fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I\u2019m sure y",

        "Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump \u201cResistance.\u201d She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill\u2019s report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects \u201ccreditably\u201d on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been \u201cworthless\u201d if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the \u201cspirit\u201d of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of \u201cspecial favors.\u201dThe charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank \u2026 As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters\u2019s office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money \u2014 despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated \u201cwithout effective underwriting standards\u201d and engaged \u201cin speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited\u2019s stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters\u2019s intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters\u2019s friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters\u2019s scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times. Resist.",

        "We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it\u2019s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you\u2019re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you\u2019re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who\u2019re willing to take part in their \u201cRest Studies\u201d \u2013 a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts\u2019 health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts\u2019 changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts\u2019 physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study\u2019s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you\u2019re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you\u2019ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you\u2019ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You\u2019ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body\u2019s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can\u2019t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you\u2019ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net",

One user, Brian Klaas, jumped to erroneous conclusions and wondered if Trump had made a Freudian slip. \u201cTrump lumps himself with his white supremacist supporters,\u201d wrote Klaas in a now-deleted tweet.The fake news stems from Politico\u2019s inaccurate transcription of Donald Trump\u2019s speech. A snapshot of the transcript on Archive.is reveals the presence of the fake quote.The updated version of the transcript fixed the error, but did not acknowledge that any edits were made. Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction ",

I\u2019m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.\u201dikili opsiyon egitim \u201cUntil Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody\u2019s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I\u2019m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I\u2019ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say \u2013 I guess I\u2019ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,\u201d Gaga concluded.",

        "usapoliticsnow admin.A string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23-year-old case that had gone completely cold. After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster\u2019s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn\u2019t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital\u2019s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible..The doctor who signed Foster\u2019s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice..The case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster\u2019s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau\u2019s resources are made available..In other words, Clinton will be getting away with murder\u2026again..",

        "9.6k SHARES Share Tweet ShareDe Soto, Missouri \u2013 Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family\u2019s living room.Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.The 16-year-old babysitter named \u2018Anna Ritchie\u2019, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.\u201cI just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,\u201d she told Officer Robert. \u201cAll I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out\u201d recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield\u2019s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.\u201cApparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,\u201d explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. \u201cTeeth marks were found on the baby\u2019s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed\u201d he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.",

        "HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It\u2019s NOT PRETTY \u2026 FOR THEM\u201cThe tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\u201d \u2013 Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT \u2013 Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson\u2019s directive to their own detriment. It\u2019s no longer political, it\u2019s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump\u2019s America First agenda and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don\u2019t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.\u201dCandidate Trump promised many things \u2013 border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and \u2013 to the extent possible \u2013 an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans \u2013 notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham \u2013 have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp.\u201dAs we reported yesterday, \u201cAn F.B.I. agent with \u2018intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case\u2019 told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.\u201dThe criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn\u2019t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation\u2019s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children\u2019s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren\u2019t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump\u2019s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It\u2019s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.And, now that they\u2019ve been caught robbing the world\u2019s largest bank \u2013 the U.S. treasury \u2013 they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.Washington\u2019s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It\u2019s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly.

        "The Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Donald Trump.This is something that the mainstream media does not wanna show.This is huge.On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting from our children first. In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, \u201cThe government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn\u2019t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn\u2019t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a \u2018religion of peace\u2019 when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.\u201dGorsuch continued, \u201cIt is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.\u201dThe Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the \u201cReligion of Peace,\u201d only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.Thanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.Scroll down to the comments and tell us what you think.",

It's appalling \u2014 like something you would see in a war zone,\" she said.\u201cHe looks terrible,\" she continues.\"His left eye is like a golf ball and bleeding, the nose looks like it could be broken.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t had an x-ray yet.\"He doesn\u2019t remember anything.\"The first thing he remembers is the police.\u201cHe is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.\u201cNothing was taken, but the transport police intervened quickly.\"London is such a beautiful, wonderful city.\"We can't start worrying about walking in the streets at 3 pm.\"\u00a9 press The 74-year-old retired diplomat, pictured with his wife, was beaten to a pulp for his political viewDaily Mail reports: Cambridge-educated Sir Christopher worked as press secretary for former chancellor Geoffrey Howe and John Major before being appointed US ambassador.He spent six years in Washington, from 1997 to 2003, becoming the longest-serving holder of his office since 1945.As ambassador, he welcomed around 35,000 guests to his home a year and was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.After retiring, he became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the former newspaper regulatory body.He is a prolific tweeter, who regularly comments on politics and foreign affairs.The former diplomat has called for Britain to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit today.He has been married to Catherine for more than 20 years.Sir Christopher's attack comes as London's crime rate has soared.Since the start of the year, more than 80 murder investigations have been launched in the capital.Forces in England and Wales logged 5.3million crimes in the year to September 2017, 14 percent up on the previous 12 months.A statement from the British Transport Police (BTP) said:\"Officers were called to Victoria London Underground Station at 2.45pm yesterday (11 July), after receiving reports that a man had been seriously assaulted.\"A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon were both arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm.\"They have been released under investigation while inquiries into the incident continue.\"A man in his seventies was taken to hospital, though his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or changing.\"Thoughts with former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, who was brutally attacked yesterday.

        "335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORYRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their \u201canatomical sex:\u201dLocal school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student\u2019s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here.Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

        "By AM Conservative Post authorFareed Zakaria, CNN host of \u2018Foreign Affairs,\u2019 has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.Zakaria\u2019s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.\u201cThe white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the \u2018white question\u2019 will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.\u201dThe blog post was removed from Zakaria\u2019s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.\u201cEvery death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,\u201d Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum",
        "Barack Obama has announced plans to become secretary general of the United Nations, allowing him to advance his globalist agenda on the world\u2019s stage.According to Al-Jarida, Obama has no intention to step away from the spotlight, much to the dismay of other world leaders such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly is planning payback for President Obama\u2019s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year. Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama\u2019s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama\u2019s plans which he calls the Obama Project. \u201cWasn\u2019t eight years of having Obama in office enough?\u201d Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. \u201cEight years during which he ignored Israel?

        "\u2018Smallville\u2019 star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: \u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants\u2019 benefit,\u201d U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.\u201cSome people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,\u201d Oxenberg said. \u201cCoercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.\u201dWhen these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney\u2019s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack\u2019s arrest report or charges\u2014as reported by the mainstream media\u2014will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is tru",

The ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in Wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade.The bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging.

She gathered up her stuff and left, together with the rest of her celebration.Vice noted:But despite all the backlash she\u2019s gotten from the right, Stephanie Wilkinson says she does not regret a thing.\u201cWe simply felt there are moments in time when folks need to live their own convictions. This appeared to be one.\u201dWhen Sanders came to the Red Hen along with her husband along with six other people on Friday night, the boxer called Wilkinson to mention the team was\u201da little concerned,\u201d Wilkinson told the Post.She headed to the restaurant, and\u2013while Sanders and her friends munched on cheeseboards\u2013called the team to a huddle in the kitchen, and asked if they wanted Sanders to leave. According to the Article, a handful of her workers are gay, and many others are revulsed by Sanders\u2019 treatment of this emergency at the boundary. They wanted her gone.Wilkinson took Sanders out into the patio and asked her to leave, telling her why the restaurant had\u201dcertain criteria\u201d like\u201dhonesty, and compassion, and collaboration,\u201d Wilkinson told the Post. Sanders agreed to proceed, gathered up her things, and headed out, followed by the remainder of her party, whose meal Wilkinson comped.Following the White House Press Secretary identified the place by name on Twitter, President Trump called it\u201dfilthy,\u201d and a army of his assistants got busy screwing with its business\u2013beginning a campaign to make a bunch of bogus dinner reservations and tanking its score on Yelp.I always had a guideline, if a restaurant is filthy on the outside, it\u2019s dirty on the inside!The restaurant\u2019s Yelp page has been bombarded with over 11,000 one-star reviews, leaving it in a sound one-and-a-half.Piggybacking on Trump\u2019s dig on the area being\u201dfilthy,\u201d several pissed-off reviewers have claimed to have discovered roaches in their food because Sanders was kicked out, but some have compared Wilkinson to a Nazi and called her and her staff\u201dun-American hateful bigots.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve a company, and I want the company to flourish. This feels just like the moment in our democracy when people need to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to maintain their morals.\u201dSaturday afternoon the Press Secretary hadn\u2019t any difficulty in telling her story and actually named the establishment on Twitter, which was followed by President Trump calling it\u201dfilthy\u201d on his Twitter page.Which in turn led to a military people deplorables wasting no time whatsoever in creating our feelings heard on social networking, on Yelp and by creating fake dinner reservations in demonstration. The Restaurant\u2019s Yelp page currently has the company at one star and a half.While on the other side, liberals were pleased to leave this slum a 5-star rating although they threw a hissy fit every time a Christian baker didn\u2019t need to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding a few years back.Wilkerson went on to confirm to the Article she feels like this is the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable decisions a",
        "\u201cYou can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn\u2019t do on TV,\u201d she says of her forthcoming weekly program.Michelle Wolf has landed a show of her own.After nearly half a decade working on Late Night With Seth Meyers and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, Wolf is set to host her own weekly show on Netflix. The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing Wolf\u2019s show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda \u2014 unless, of course, it\u2019s funny. \u201cYou can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn\u2019t do on TV,\u201d Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix\u2019s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: \"We're thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.\"The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (\"I want equal pay! And a chardonnay\") to dating and other social issues.Though Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.By jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central \u2014 and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network\u2019s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.Looking ahead, Wolf's Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The President\u2019s Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.Wolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman.",

She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.Mateo said via Fox News \u2013 \u201cWhile undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.\u201dTrending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! \u2018That Is Not Acceptable Here \u2013 I Won\u2019t Allow It!\u2019Senate Bill 174 made Mateo\u2019s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.\u201cCalifornia is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,\u201d Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill\u2019s author said in a statement. \u201cUndocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can\u2019t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.\u201dIt marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De Le\u00f3n\u2019s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo\u2019s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting \u2013 In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did.

(@LizbethMateo) March 15, 2018Interestingly enough, however, Moteo seems to be confused about which country she prefers and which country has her loyalty. In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish \u2013\u201cEverything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.\u201dIf she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.It is important to note that while Mateo is the first \u201cunprotected\u201d illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.De Le\u00f3n and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.Many were also quick to point out Mateo\u2019s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law.

        "Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers.According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes.Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson\u2019s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated.\u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.\u201dMs. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson\u2019s death.Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death.The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death.",

        "The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company\u2019s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and \u201crunning Mall of America into the ground,\u201d on the basis of Santa \u201calways having been white in the Bible.\u201d \u201cNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,\u201d Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was \u201cthe last straw\u201d in corporate America\u2019s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, \u201cbecause they realized they couldn\u2019t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they\u2019ve been using so far.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won\u2019t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don\u2019t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,\u201d Palin added. \u201cThe Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don\u2019t, if we let them get away with it, what\u2019s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we\u2019re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that\u2019s happening by accident?\u201d\u201cNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,\u201d she concluded.",
        "Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,\u201d said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. \u201cBut Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he\u2019s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump\u2019s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President\u2019s ice cream from the carton.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President\u2019s eating habits to the press.\u201cIt\u2019s borderline creepy,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThe first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he\u2019s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It\u2019s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s McDonalds habits are even weirder.\u201cHe orders the same thing every time,\u201d said the staffer. \u201cHe orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M\u2019s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.\u201dNo wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit.

        "USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumptionYou might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can\u2019t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama\u2019s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico \u2014 and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don\u2019t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it \u2014 because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:NaturalNews.com",

        "A senior Iranian cleric and member of parliament has just dropped a bombshell.He is claiming that the Obama administration, as part of negotiating during the Iran Deal, granted U.S. citizenship to 2500 Iranians including family members of government officials.From Fox News:Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran\u2019s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the country\u2019s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country\u2019s Fars News agency. He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.\u201cWhen Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIf today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.\u201d The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s inner circle, added: \u201cIt should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.\u201dHe said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. \u201cagainst our national interests.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear who he\u2019s talking about and whether he\u2019s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.But it obviously raises a concerning question.There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to believe.And it shouldn\u2019t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can\u2019t get a straight answer.Asked about the cleric\u2019s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.\u201d Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official\u2019s allegation. \u201cThis sounds like totally made up BS,\u201d she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran\u2019s elite. \u201cMany ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,\u201d Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. \u201cThe regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.\u201d Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: \u201cIranians don\u2019t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran.

        "There is not a day that goes by that we don\u2019t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn\u2019t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called \u201creligion of peace\u201d are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for \u201cIslam anti-blasphemy\u201d laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis\u2019 local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to \u201charass them.\u201d The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city\u2019s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any \u201charassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,\u201d according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.\u201cSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.\u201dThe city\u2019s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: \u201cI will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump\u2019s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.\u201d The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal\u2019s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don\u2019t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don\u2019t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim\u2019s demands. This \u201canti-blasphemy\u201d hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Ger",
        "It\u2019s no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.When you\u2019re done imaging that nightmare scenario, it\u2019s important to realize that the fight isn\u2019t over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.That\u2019s why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, it\u2019s been a long time coming for this order.Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about \u201cany and all\u201d files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled \u201cBlocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.\u201d\u201cI, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.\u201dNearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did \u201cundermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.\u201d Due to Soros\u2019s illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didn\u2019t President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? It\u2019s because Soros flooded Obama and Hillary\u2019s Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared \u201cit is the central focus of my life\u201d and \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillary\u2019s highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying \u201cdemocracy is now in crisis.\u201d Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.It didn\u2019t just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, it\u2019s safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.It\u2019s about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for fund",
        "Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. \u201cWe thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there\u2019s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting\u201d, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. \u201cThey are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal\u201d, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. \u201cHopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern\u201d, said Dr. Polowotski. \u201cBoaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution\u201d. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. \u201cWe were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it\u201d, said Bob. \u201cWe were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think\u201d, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.",
        "Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcriptPrepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.Together, united in the",
        "Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city\u2019s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.As workers slung a strap around the statue\u2019s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.\u201cThis historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,\u201d Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.\u201cIt will be nice\u201d, Landrieu said, \u201cto see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.\u201dThe Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.\u201cWe would have preferred it to be in the daytime,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cso everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.\u201dBefore the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators \u2014 both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included \u201cWhere\u2019s Mitch?\u201d while opponents chanted, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.\u201dAs Fox news reported earlier, the mayor\u2019s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.",
        "Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff\u2019s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG\u2019s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI\u2019s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201cWe constantly promote \u2018see something, say something,\u2019 and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. \u2018See something, say something\u2019 is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,\u201d Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel\u2019s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn\u2019t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine\u2019s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel\u2019s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel\u2019s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff\u2019s car that read, \u201cOur new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?\u201dThe tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike ",

        "Mike Pence said he didn\u2019t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for \u201cspeaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior\u201d \u2013 which she said had \u201cshaken (her) to the core.\u201d\u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d Pence argued, \u201cI have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That\u2019s the first thing I don\u2019t quite get. Secondly, if she\u2019s the First Lady, shouldn\u2019t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What\u2019s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That\u2019s not what she should be doing.\u201dThe governor of Indiana also said that she \u201chas no business\u201d commenting on men and their \u201crestroom talk,\u201d as well as that that\u2019s not \u201cladylike behavior.\u201d \u201cNow, I know that the word \u2018lady\u2019 is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she\u2019s not behaving like one, at least as of late,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she was a real lady, she wouldn\u2019t be commenting on men\u2019s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIf we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn\u2019t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she\u2019s not only being vocal about it, but she\u2019s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can\u2019t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can\u2019t fool me, just like she can\u2019t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.\u201d\u201cHow many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?\u201d Pence asked. \u201cHe has apologized for it several times, and I really don\u2019t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, the first lady also thinks she\u2019s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\u201cThere is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn\u2019t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama.

        "A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore.Natural News reports:In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:\u201cAl Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the \u2018global warming\u2019 debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.\u201dClimate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.Al Gore\u2019s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 \u2013 a year that was touted as being \u201cthe hottest ever\u201d in the Earth\u2019s history \u2013 there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.Debunking the \u201c97 percent\u201d lieOn top of those \u201cinconvenient truths,\u201d the White House\u2019s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the \u201c97 percent\u201d statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.From the National Review:\u201cA 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.\u201dOther mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda \u2013 even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth \u2013 not human activity.Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoaxBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you\u2019re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 \u2013 largely due to investments in fake \u201cgreen tech\u201d companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.You might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.",

        "President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it\u2019s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn\u2019t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a \u2018discriminatory manner,\u2019 particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a \u2018no\u2019 vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the \u201cimposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.\u201dTo have a \u2018no\u2019 vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:\u201cIt is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.\u201d \u201cThis is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.\u201dSince taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.",
        "An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is \u201crigged.\u201dDan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an \u201cgangland-style execution\u201d, hours after blowing the whistle on the \u201crigged Super Bowl\u201d backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend.Goodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football League\u2019s Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl featuring the two teams.However Goodes went \u201coff-script\u201d in Minneapolis and was \u201cphysically removed\u201d from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as \u201ctotally corrupt\u201d and claiming the Super Bowl is \u201cfixed.\u201dTelling reporters that he is a \u201cfootball fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second\u201d, Goodes said \u201cFootball in America in 2018 doesn\u2019t need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test.\u201cI like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can\u2019t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won\u2019t allow it.\u201cFootball in America won\u2019t recover from this.\u201dEarly reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an \u201cgangland-style execution\u201d in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a \u201crigged game\u201d that will earn \u201cmaximum revenue\u201d for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.\u201cThis is the biggest scam in sports history,\u201d Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. \u201cThe Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.\u201d\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s scripted? I\u2019ve read the damn thing.\u201c\u201cYou need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can\u2019t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don\u2019t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn\u2019t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn\u2019t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.\u201d\u201cThe sad thing is that it\u2019s legal. Can you believe that? It\u2019s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.\u201dExplaining that the NFL is officially registered as \u201centertainment,\u201d Goodes said \u201cThe NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.\u201dThe NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as \u201centertainment\u201d rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate \u201cfranchises\u201d they would want you to believe.In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing \u201centertainment\u201d in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.The only other \u201csport\u201d that occupies this legal position is the WWE.How are games rigged?According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.\u201cHave you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn\u2019t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they\u2019re not.

        "The Bumble Bee tuna processing plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., on Oct. 15, 2012. (Photo: Nick Ut, AP)Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon \u2014 even in fatalities.San Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that \"we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident.\" It said it disagreed with the charges filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and that it was \"exploring all options with respect to those charges.\"Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

        "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 \u2014 a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida\u2019s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida\u2019s Department of Children and Families (DCF) \u2014 the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida \u2014 confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.\u201cThe dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state\u2019s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,\u201d said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures \u2014 such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week \u2014 and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year \u2014 and every year after 2013 \u2014 is continuing.",

        "320 SHARES Share TweetPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That\u2019s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don\u2019t want migrants who can\u2019t fend for themselves. Maybe it\u2019s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It\u2019s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It\u2019s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what\u2019s happening in Germany, with Merkel\u2019s \u201ccome on in\u201d policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There\u2019s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that\u2019s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.\u201cJust this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,\u201d he stated on his weekly radio address. \u201cAs an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.\u201d\u201cYou cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.\u201dCompare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can\u2019t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers \u2013 and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job \u2013 but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j",

Of course, they\u2019re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders\u2019 family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she\u2019s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson\u2019s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson\u2019s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.\u201cConsidering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,\u201d Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration\u2019s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining \u201cunaffiliated\u201d as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who\u2019d never stepped through their door.\u201cKindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,\u201d said a post on the family-owned restaurant\u2019s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location\u2019s rating has plummetted from \u201c4.8 stars to three-point-something.\u201d An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has \u201cabsolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.\u201dWilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn\u2019t enjoy \u201cconfrontation\u201d but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.\u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of confrontation,\u201d Wilkinson told The Post. \u201cI have a business, and I want the business to thrive.\u201d But, she went on to say, \u201cThis feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.\u201dWhen the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are \u201cNa",
        "Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday.Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma Gonz\u00e1lez has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]Gonz\u00e1lez, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine\u2019s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up Gonz\u00e1lez as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of Gonz\u00e1lez tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, Gonz\u00e1lez is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: \u2018No one would know your names\u2019 if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading \u201c#Vorw\u00e4rts!\u201d \u2014 the German word for \u201cforward\u201d and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl \u2014 Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was \u201csatire.\u201d It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: \u201cJust a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),\u201d referencing a user named \u201cLinda NRA Supporter\u201d who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan\u2019s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of Gonz\u00e1lez and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right\u2019s criticism of Hogg\u2019s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first \u201ctop news\u201d video that appears in a YouTube search for \u201cDavid Hogg\u201d is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to not just go after this kid,\u201d host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of Gonz\u00e1lez have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.\u201cEmma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,\u201d one meme shared on Reddit\u2019s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post\u2019s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).\u201cThis is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don\u2019t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,\u201d said a post on King\u2019s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of Gonz\u00e1lez at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics \u2014 a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.\u201cThe initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it\u2019s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. \u2018Boycott this, boycott that.\u2019 It\u2019s detracting from the actual discussions,\u201d Kashuv told The Post\u2019s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg\u2019s comments at the rally were \u201cegregious and inflammatory,\u201d Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg\u2019s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers",

I cried for help and that is when he stuffed me into a freezer where I saw dead bodies. I must have passed out from shock or something but I am happy you guys found me,\u201d said to police by the victim.Officer Douglas, who was searching for Thompson, found him in a crawl space in the basement.

        "BREAKING: Barack Obama just secretly fled the U.S. after Donald Trump found some disturbing criminal evidence he left behind in the Oval Office. This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won\u2019t soon forget!Mad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn\u2019t cover their tracks well enough.The members of Obama\u2019s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the \u201cPresidential Daily Briefings\u201d (PDB).\u201cDuring the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the \u2018small group\u2019 collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,\u201d reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama\u2019s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.\u201cNunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was \u2018not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.\u2019 So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,\u201d reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn\u2019t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called \u201cNational Security Action,\u201d who says their mission is, \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America\u2019s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.\u201dThese people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it. Unfortunately for them, however, McCabe\u2019s firing makes it clear that they won\u2019t get away with this act of treason.What do you think about this? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.",
        "Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government. In the past two weeks, after receiving a...\u201cNOS\u201d stands for \u201cNovus Ordo Seclorum,\u201d or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama\u2019s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It\u2019s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama\u2019s \u201cteam\u201d has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation\u2019s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place \u2014 along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC \u2014 is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama\u2019s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren\u2019t your friends. Get out of the house and don\u2019t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.",

        "President Trump decided to go ahead and do what no other president has had the stones to do last night and launched a covert campaign to eliminate the threat of North Korean nuclear and conventional weaponry.An independent source at the Pentagon is confirming for us what the mainstream media won\u2019t until they\u2019ve figured out an angle to make Trump look bad: North Korea\u2019s military is in ruins and not a single civilian was hurt.The reporter who managed to get the story told LLOD:\u201cA cute little airman whose name I won\u2019t disclose confirmed that Admiral Fitzwallis gave the order to go to 17 SEAL teams on the ground covertly in North Korea.

According to the airman, North Korea is brighter now than it ever has been at night because \u201cit is currently on fire.\u201dNow reports are coming in from sources on the ground in Pyongyang that Supreme Leader and all-around nitwit Kim Jong Un has been killed in the action. Immediately afterward, Kim was spotted on radio giving a death to America speech that was recorded several years ago, but the actual dictator hasn\u2019t been spotted.From the Presidential Palace, crews are working on a colla[psed section of the building that houses the living quarters of Kim and his family.We\u2019ll keep you updated on this developing story.",
        "Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian AgentsAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds \u2014 literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name \u201cAlexi Jonesinov\u201d) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.\u201cWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,\u201d one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people\u2019s actions as \u201cRussian neuro-brain hacking.\u201dWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cgoofy.\u201d However, Peskov suspiciously asked \u201cvere is Moose and Squirrel?\u201dNSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people\u2019s brains, he\u2019s \u201cnever seen anything on this scale before.\u201dThe Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts\u2026almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don\u2019t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven\u2019t noticed, Trump\u2019s people have most of the guns.",
        "804 SHARES Share TweetAnd once again the mainstream media ends up with egg on its face. This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.As the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.Witness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a gun on me but wish I did\u201d pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa \u2014 \u13e2\u13d2\u13a5s\u13df\u13a5\u13de\u13de\u13aa\u2019s \u13c9\u13a5\u13ac\u13b3 \u2122\ufe0f (@PriscillasView) April 3, 2018\u201cWhen asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, \u201cI knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.\u201dThe witness also added, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.\u201dHe said he wished he had a gun. And that\u2019s the way he should feel. And that\u2019s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm. And no, they didn\u2019t just mean muskets like you liberals keep trying to tell us. \u2018Wow.. they will run this poor man out of looney California! \u2014 al_waisman (@al_waisman) April 4, 2018Reports are confirming that this particular shooting was just a disgruntled woman who wanted to kill her boyfriend, which would potentially make the event a case of domestic violence. And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.California is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50\u2019s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.I am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms\u2026 they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that\u2019s all.The shooter has now been identified via ABC 30SAN BRUNO, Calif. \u2014 Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.Aghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.Sources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.According to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.Police and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.She embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube \u201cAd-apocalypse\u201d where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.Neistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.It appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform. She wrote on her website, \u201cBe aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term pr",

        "8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president\u2019s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the \u201charm\u201d he claims. The \u201cBe careful what you wish for Max!\u201d quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps \u201cthe Second Amendment people\u201d i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump\u2019s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president\u2019s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd \u201cfaces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\u201dLloyd\u2019s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters\u2019 Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:\u201cIf you continue to make threats towards the president, you\u2019re going to wind up dead, Maxine, \u2019cause we\u2019ll kill you.\u201cThe voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump\u2019s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump\u2019s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!",
        "Wouldn\u2019t you just love to carry on sleeping on a Monday morning without having to submit to the Monday morning blues and get ready for work? What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn\u2019t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don\u2019t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their \u201cBed Rest Studies\u201d, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I\u2019d had enough, I\u2019d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.You wouldn\u2019t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!As long as they remain laying down. You\u2019re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.NASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.NASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:Understanding how one\u2019s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.Understanding the impact of one\u2019s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The experiment will consist of two categories.The exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body\u2019s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.",

He does so for the sole intent of lining his own pockets at the expense of others.George Soros now lives in the United States and has been involved in many of the anti-Trump protests around the country. He has paid salaries and housing for many of the leaders of Black Lives Matters group, in addition to paying young people to protest Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the U.S.He has done this before in different countries throughout Europe and Asia. Basically, he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one.Russia was once a victim of his demented financial upheaval. Back in the \u201890\u2019s he wrote a letter that besmirched the Russian currency and said it was overvalued. Investors immediately panicked and dumped the Russian currency. The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets.Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros. Although it took years, Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin officially issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros for his role in collapsing Russia\u2019s currency and the resulting financial meltdown.Now, as an American citizen, it is a bit tricky to remove him, but when Trump takes office, it may completely change. We\u2019ll have to see. To learn more, check out the provided video below.",
        "The state of Michigan is quickly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the past 8 years. Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a \u201cmini Baghdad,\u201d but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another \u201caccomplishment\u201d on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the \u201clargest scam in United States history.\u201dMuslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation\u2019s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation\u2019s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the \u201clargest scam\u201d that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:\u201cOfficials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam\u2019s value.\u2018Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,\u2019 Sessions said.A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.\u201dThe ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers\u2019 noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here\u2019s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet\u2026all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid\u2019s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in De",

The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.\u2018As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD\u2019s request for information about this \u201cevent\u201d, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion\u2013 Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73\u2014with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database \u201ctarget hit\u201d on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a \u201cprobable witness\u201d against the Clinton Foundation.,\u2018Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey\u2014and whose inclusion in the SVR\u2019s database of \u201cpotential witnesses\u201d against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a \u201ccentral identified and named figure\u201d in the creation of a document titled \u201cTraining Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine\u201d for the New Jersey Department of Education.\u2019\u2018Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis\u2014that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death\u2014and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)\u2014and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its \u201cemergency administration\u201d led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it\u2014and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.\u2019\u2018Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a \u201cmain target\u201d person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history\u2014that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation\u2014and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education\u2014and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions\u2014that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses\u2019 offices throughout the United States\u2014with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools\u2014and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their \u201cEpiPen Law\u201d that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.\u2019\u2018Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch\u2014who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens\u2014became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.\u2014with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million\u2014and whose \u201cprotection\u201d for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin\u2019s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.\u2019\u2018To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her \u201cactive and knowing\u201d participation in the United States opioid crisis\u2014that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year\u2014nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma\u2014who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a \u201cblind eye\u201d to their flooding of America with opioids\u2014and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin\u2019s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.\u2019\u2018This report, after describing the",
        "President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he\u2019s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here\u2019s what WJ just reported:\u201cThe staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the \u2018Questionnaire for National Security Positions.\u2019 The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant\u2019s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.\u201dThe six staffers included the daughter of President Trump\u2019s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:\u201cWiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.\u201dThe form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.It\u2019s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:\u201cDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be \u2018their most sacred obligation.\u2019 Schiff added, referring to Trump: \u2018I\u2019m sure there are people in the community who feel they don\u2019t know where he\u2019s coming from on Russia.'\u201dJust as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",

        "In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America\u2019s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)\u201cMy audience likes Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.\u201dSome of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that \u201cthe Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.\u201d Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: \u201cStop it Liberals\u2026Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here\u2019s Why.\u201d That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze\u2019s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people\u2019s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)",

        "George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump\u2019s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.During his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.The harsh rhetoric of Trump\u2019s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it \u201csome weird s--t\u201d and Jimmy Carter saying he \u201cflinched\u201d when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump\u2019s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the \u201cunwritten rule\u201d that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.\u201cThe immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,\u201d George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. \u201cThis kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it\u2019s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president\u2026 is pretty unusual.\u201dAs Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he\u2019s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was \u201cheartened\u201d by the protests following Trump\u2019s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump\u2019s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. \u201cI expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,\u201d Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama\u2019s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump\u2019s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn\u2019s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn\u2019s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. \u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,\u201d Bush said in an interview with \u201cToday\u201d in February. \u201cWe need an independent media to hold people like me to account.\u201dAs for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. \u201cI am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,\u201d Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump\u2019s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women\u2019s movement would be \u201cinvigorated\u201d by Trump and that he didn\u2019t see \u201cany glimmer of hope\u201d from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman\u2019s presidential campaign, didn\u2019t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know much,\u201d Clinton said in late December. \u201cOne thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.\u201dGeorge H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that\u2019s not really unprecedented,\u201d Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. \u201cIf it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.\u201dCurrent and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.\u201dThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.\u201cMost of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,\u201d Mack McLarty, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, said.For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.\u201cWhat would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cIf we see that none of the former presidents want",

Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement \u201cFor survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting\u201d using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.Dammegard\u2019s source received the following email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department and forwarded it to Dammegard:Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018.

        "UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking \u201cout of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,\u201d according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a \u201csanctuary county\u201d in May 2014. The county only cooperates with \u201cICE holds\u201d if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department\u2019s \u201c1.0 Policy Statement\u201d reads: \u201cNo person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.\u201d The policy adds that \u201cthe immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff\u2019s Office personnel execute their duties.\u201dAccording to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated \u2014 about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.",

        "Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as \u2013 Enya\u2019s \u2018Who Can Say\u2019.After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home\u2019s basement.According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement\u2019s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.William Provost, who police believe to be the group\u2019s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:\u201cI find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don\u2019t, so I stick to what works for me\u201d.Upon searching the home\u2019s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift \u2018tool wall\u2019 that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.\u201cThough modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201dProvost\u2019s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer\u2019s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.All three men are current",
        "Update:The Syrian Arab Red Crescent statement was reported, and at the time we had no reason to believe it was not true. Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.\u2014The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn\u2019t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might\u2019ve been exposed to.(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)Chemical attack or no, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn\u2019t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these \u201creal\u201d patients to confirm an attack.Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",

        "Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted networkUPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump.During a Fox news segment in which Republican strategist Frank Luntz thought the media should give Trump more credit for the nation's economic \"clear recovery,\" someone behind the scenes made a boo boo.When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll \u2013 one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News.Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy.Kurtz quickly said, \"This is not the graphic we're looking for \u2013 hold off. Take that down please!\".@FoxNews the least trusted US network.

        "Niagara Falls| Divers from the U.S coast guard took part this morning, in a delicate wreck recoveryoperation to bring to the surface a Nazisubmarine discovered two weeks ago at the bottomof Lake Ontario.The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the \u201cBattle of the St. Lawrence\u201d. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.\u201cWe have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,\u201d Professor Carpenter told reporters. \u201cThis could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported \u201cBattle of Niagara Falls\u201d which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.\u201dThe restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.",
        "Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He\u2019s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he\u2019s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. \u201cMy question is pretty straightforward,\u201d Kline told Price. \u201cWhy do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?\u201d Price\u2019s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. \u201cI took care of a lot of patients with cancer,\u201d Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.\u201d\u201cBut, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you\u2019re doing here, because you\u2019re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?\u201d Kline wouldn\u2019t back down. \u201cAre you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?\u201d Price thought for a second, then replied: \u201cLook, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone\u2019s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me \u2013 I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.\u201dHe continued, \u201cI understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who\u2019ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he\u2019s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I\u2019m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we\u2019re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.\u201d\u201cPut simply, we have to plug some holes \u2013 of which, by the way, there are plenty \u2013 and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,\u201d the orthopedic surgeon added. \u201cUnfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it\u2019s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer \u2013 I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about, Brian \u2013 they can\u2019t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?\u201d\u201cAt the risk of sounding insensitive, we\u2019ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it\u2019s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it\u2019s a lousy way to live anyway, and I\u2019m sorry to say it out loud, but it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Price concluded.",

He converted to Islam two years ago.However, what those reports don\u2019t mention is that the would-be terrorist also \u2018liked\u2019 numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including \u2018Trump Resistance Movement\u2019, \u2018Things Trump Supporters Say\u2019, \u2018US Democratic Socialists\u2019, \u2018Progressive Politics\u2019, and \u2018Jeremy Corbyn\u2019.Some of Jameson\u2019s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera.

        "26.6k SHARES Share TweetIt turns out that our moon isn\u2019t alone out there, orbiting our planet on its own. Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.The new moon isn\u2019t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.The smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon\u2019s orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet\u2019s \u2018original\u2019 moon.The \u2018new\u2019 moon is tilted at around 8\u00b0 and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.The orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth\u2019s smaller moon for coming centuries.The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.\u201cSince 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,\u201d said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \u201cOne other asteroid \u2014 2003 YN107 \u2014 followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth\u2019s companion for centuries to come.\u201dSourceLike this: Like Loading...",
        "Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she\u2019s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle\u2019s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone\u2019s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she\u2019d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle\u2019s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that\u2019s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama\u2019s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband\u2019s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, \u201cOn Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.\u201dWright diagnosed Mrs. Obama\u2019s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.\u201cShe\u2019s in legacy building mode. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThis is the time she\u2019s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.\u201dAs First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.\u201cI think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that\u2019s been true over the last three administrations,\u201d she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she\u2019s now suffering a feeling of \u201chopelessness\u201d with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It\u2019s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America\u2019s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our coun",

        "Year 2017 does not seem to be going well for the United States of America. Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook \u2014 an American corporation \u2014 being banned in the country.Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. \"Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,\" said Trump.Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's \"commitment\" should have not just been limited to Facebook. \"You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,\" Rowlinson said. \"You wouldn't get this from any other guy,\" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.Donald Trump's remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

        "It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she\u2019s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby\u2019s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn\u2019t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.",
        "Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and Russia\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he\u2019s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump\u2019s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI\u2019s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok\u2019s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok \u201cintends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.\u201dThe letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with \u201cspecific investigative decisions,\u201d but said that comment and others \u201cimplies a willingness to take official action.\u201dStrzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn\u2019t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump\u2019s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there\u2019s \u201cno question\u201d that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that \u201cI think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.\u201dMueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent \u201cintends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that\u2019s a topic, and his own integrity.\u201dTrump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general\u2019s findings.

        "Lisa Page, former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship.According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed \u2018assets\u2019 had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s 30,000+ \u201cmissing\u201d emails, federal sources said.The Russians didn\u2019t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America\u2019s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary\u2019s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude \u2014 publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary\u2019s sensitive and top secret emails \u2014 would have derailed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn\u2019t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton\u2019s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary\u2019s emails? The FBI didn\u2019t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president\u2019s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server \u2014 and intercepted by a communist country \u2014 yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton\u2019s and her inner circle\u2019s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI \u2014 specifically Strzok \u2014 about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?",

        "The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised \u201cfull implementation\u201d of the UN\u2019s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue\u2026 perhaps they don\u2019t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN\u2019s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American \u2018representatives\u2019 at the conference agreed to begin developing \u2018legal frameworks\u2019 (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce \u201cproper management\u201d of \u201csmall arms and light weapons\u201d stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes \u2018stockpiles\u2019 owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find \u2018illicit\u2019 ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN\u2019s history of pushing for gun control measures, it\u2019s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN\u2019s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The \u2018Programme of Action\u2019 also allows UN \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 to go to member nations to \u2018assist\u2019 in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to \u2018help\u2019 speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen \u2018coordinated approaches\u2019 nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a \u2018national point of contact\u2019 to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to \u2018make better use\u2019 of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be \u2018in compliance\u2019 with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and \u2018non-proliferation,\u2019 which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to \u2018significantly reduce\u2019 illicit flows of small arms through means such as \u2018voluntary surrender\u2019 programmes and \u2018illicit weapons\u2019 recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don\u2019t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, the",

        "The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.In protesting the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.\u201cThis is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,\u201d liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama\u2019s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.\u201cICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,\u201d Fallon tweeted. \u201cDems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.\u201dThomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.\u201cThese politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,\u201d Homan said Thursday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201dBut the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.\u201cICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,\u201d Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. \u201cBut let\u2019s not abuse the power.\u201dSince then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.\u201cKamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,\u201d Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. \u201cIt should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.\u201dHe added: \u201cShe should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.\u201dMirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- \u201cshould be asked the same question.\u201dPELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS \u2018UNJUST AND CRUEL\u2019The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Abolish ICE.\u201d The writer accused the agency of being part of an \u201cunbridled white-supremacist surveillance state\u201d and called it \u201can unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\u201cThough the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it\u2019s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,\u201d McElwee wrote.Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as \"unjust and cruel.\"Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff\u2019s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR \u2018RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA\u2019Sessions called California\u2019s \"open borders\" policies a \u201cradical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.\u201d\u201cIt cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can this be a sound polic",

That\u2019s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.\u201cVery rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don\u2019t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children.

        "A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the \u201cbest way to help Israel\u201d.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton\u2019s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government\u2014and specifically to do this because it is in Israel\u2019s interests.\u201cThe best way to help Israel deal with Iran\u2019s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,\u201d Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran\u2019s \u201catom bomb\u201d program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to \u201cjustify\u201d destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran\u2019s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran\u2019s \u201catom bomb\u201d program threatens Israel\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other \u201cadversaries of Israel\u201d such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to \u201cgo nuclear as well,\u201d all of which would threaten Israel\u2019s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran\u2019s nuclear program and Syria\u2019s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about \u2014 but cannot talk about \u2014 is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the \u201cstrategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria\u201d that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel\u2019s security.This would not come about through a \u201cdirect attack,\u201d Clinton admits, because \u201cin the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel\u201d this has never occurred, but through its alleged \u201cproxies.\u201dThe end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel\u2019s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel\u2019s security, it would also ease Israel\u2019s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad \u201cand his family\u201d with violence is the \u201cright thing\u201d to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u2019s mind.The email prov",

        "Espa\u00f1olThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year\u2019s flu \u2013 which may continue to affect Americans into April \u2013 we\u2019re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season\u2019s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we\u2019re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year\u2019s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we\u2019ve learned so far about this season\u2019s vaccines and the steps we\u2019re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year\u2019s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season\u2019s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We\u2019re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn\u2019t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season\u2019s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don\u2019t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season\u2019s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year\u2019s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we\u2019re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season\u2019s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.Working to determine the root causesToward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We\u2019re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system\u2019s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We\u2019re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season\u2019s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season\u2019s vaccines should be produced.Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu seasonWhile this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season\u2019s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee",

The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn\u2019t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry\u2019s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump\u2019s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a \u201cworking trip\u201d where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go \u201cone better\u201d than Obama\u2019s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowRead more: Melania Trump \u201cwent bananas\u201d when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry.

Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she\u2019s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn\u2019t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore \u201cgroped her in the alley behind the\u201d church they both attended in 1957. \u201cIt was the most horrifying moment of my life,\u201d she told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. \u201cRoy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,\u201d she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif\u2019s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn\u2019t say anything until he was running for Senator because they \u201cfeared for their lives.\u201d Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion \u201cshe\u201d and her \u201chusband\u201d Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit\u2019s Charles C.

        "A dispute in Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader\u2019s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor\u2019s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel\u2019s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent\u2019s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That\u2019s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel\u2019s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it\u2019s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn\u2019t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party\u2019s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It\u2019s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany\u2019s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU ar",

        "Seth Rich Seth Rich- EDITOR'S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:FOX 5 DC: \u201cYou have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...\u201dWHEELER: \"For sure...\"FOX 5 DC: \u201c...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?\"WHEELER: \"Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as \"miscommunication.\"When asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.We reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, \"The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original story:It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that \"the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.\u201dWhen we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, \u201cAbsolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"Wheeler also told us, \"I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, \u2018Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can\u2019t share any information with you.\u2019 Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don\u2019t think it comes from the chief\u2019s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].Wheeler told FOX 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.FOX 5's Melanie Alnwick spoke with D.C. Police on Tuesday and was told that Wheeler\u2019s assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the Rich case was false.The family sent Alnwick a statement on Tuesday with the following statement:\"As we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"PREVIOUS COVERAGE ON THE SETH RICH MURDER INVESTIGATION:Family of DNC staffer Seth Rich seeking to raise money to help solve his murderRepublican lobbyist says murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich linked to Russian operativesMother of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich pleads for public's helpRepublican lobbyist offers $100K reward in murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth RichWikiLeaks offers $20K reward in murder of DNC staffer Seth",

In 2011, Trump went as far as to falsely accuse then-President Barack Obama of failing to send Christmas greetings, while remembering to mark the African festival of Kwanzaa.In part of his effort to rally evangelical Christians to his camp, Trump made the issue a running theme during his 2016 presidential election campaign, repeatedly promising at his rallies that he would \u201cbring back\u201d the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201dskip - Sarah Huckabee Sanders>>The Palestinians just gave Netanyahu what he always wanted for Christmas | Analysisskip - Sanders reaction 1No one else find it oddly concerning at WH press conference today Sarah Sanders started with bringing up Christmas as \u201c birth of our savior \u201c.....not all Americans would agree that this was appropriate place to discuss her religion \u2014 Karen Delaney (@KarenDelaney9) December 7, 2017skip - Sanders reaction 2@PressSec The stories of giving & of stepping up were inspirational, as you intended.

        "Maxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant. She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor.

She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!Sources: Teddy Stick \u2013 1tch",

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.Congresswoman and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on December 19, 2015. Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty Images\"Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,\" Damron said in a emailed statement.Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a \"riskier\" forms of collateral, according to court documents.However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a \"high-intensity supervision program,\" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney\u2019s office spokesman.Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.A hearing is slated for August 21.Awan\u2019s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and \"began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.\"\"For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,\" Gowen said in an emailed statement.\"Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter.

        "Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump\u2019s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, \u201cSolyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.\u201dOur Secret Service source supports that contention.\u201cObama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn\u2019t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama\u2019s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don\u2019t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I\u2019m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,\u201d our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)",
        "CNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May.While Fox News increased its total viewers by a healthy 6 percent and MSNBC held steady, CNN\u2019s viewership took a nosedive, signalling that the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNN\u2019s relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channel\u2019s ratings crisis is even more severe.CNN lies.Numbers do not\u2026Last week, during the all-important primetime hours, CNN was only able to average 844K total viewers. During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN\u2019s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN\u2019s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN\u2019s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN\u2019s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC\u2019s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.The bottom line is that CNN\u2019s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.",
        "Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman\u2019s life or preventing the \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\u201cAt the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,\u201d Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. \u201cWomen are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.\u201dHe continued, \u201cOur mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there\u2019s one very simple reason why I did it. That\u2019s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they\u2019re supposed to be closed, if she doesn\u2019t have the foresight to make sure she doesn\u2019t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.\u201d\u201cA woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we\u2019re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child \u2013 a being who\u2019s done no wrong and only exists as its mother\u2019s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you another thing \u2013 as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn\u2019t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,\u201d the governor concluded.",

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.\u201d he admits, visibly puzzled. \u201cIt is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,\u201d he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region\u2019s waters \u201cis highly unlikely\u201d as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.",

        "It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. \"You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, \"Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of \u2018convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen\u2019s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.",

An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense.

        "The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can\u2019t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that \u201cabortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.\u201d \u201cSo, let\u2019s get that straight right away \u2013 I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn\u2019t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we\u2019re murderers of innocent beings who can\u2019t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?\u201d the Indiana governor said.\u201cAnd as if that wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Pence continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that\u2019s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost \u2013 we can\u2019t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let\u2019s be clear. And that\u2019s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I\u2019m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.\u201dPence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. \u201cFirst and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We\u2019d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.\u201dDonald Trump\u2019s new running mate also said, \u201cBasically, if I\u2019d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they\u2019d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it\u2019s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher\u2019s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I\u2019m not a murderer.\u201d\u201cAnd it gets worse \u2013 when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana\u2019s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I\u2019m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,\u201d Pence concluded.",
        "Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report.The women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them.One woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore \u201ctook off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes.\u201dCorfman told the Post that Moore \u201ctouched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.\u201dThe outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying.\u201cThis garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,\u201d Moore said.Former White House adviser Stephen Bannon helped Moore trounce establishment favorite Luther Strange in a September Republican primary, over President Trump\u2019s warning that Moore was less electable.Moore currently is in a close race against Democrat Doug Jones ahead of a Dec. 12 election. \u2013 Washington ExaminerStephanie McCrummen, the reporters who co-wrote the Washington Post hit piece on Judge Roy Moore, apparently has a history of \u201cfaking\u201d things like fake checks for instance\u2026According to the anti-Trump publication, Red State, McCrummen, who works for the Washington Post, (who many consider to be \u201cfake news, after using mulitple \u201cunnamed sources\u201d in an attempt to tie President Trump to the Russians), has a criminal record that involves writing a FAKE check.Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown.Ms. McCrummen\u2019s criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19 \u2013 False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.Ms. McCrummen\u2019s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona\u2019s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states\u2019 criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes.Sean Hannity ripped into the media frenzy over the Judge Moore scandal on his show last night.

        "The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States\u2026THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:\u2018DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!\u2019 The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York\u2019s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about \u2018attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,\u2019\u201cHe said further that he would \u2018continue to create chaos\u2019 for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.\u201dDonald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It\u2019s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world\u2019s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is \u2018very interested in communications,\u2019 which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him \u2018a real-estate genius\u2019 who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970\u2019s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. \u2018With manufacturing leaving,\u2019 says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, \u2018and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.\u2019The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump\u2019s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.\u2018He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,\u2019 a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren\u2019t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: \u2018If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.\u2019 Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.\u2018He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,\u2019 says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. \u2018I don\u2019t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,\u2019 he says, \u2018but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: \u2018Tell us what you want, you\u2019re going to get it anyway.\u2019\u2018Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,\u2019 says a developer\u2026 He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.\u2019Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s friend and attorney, adds: \u2018He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.\u2019Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970\u2019s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son\u2019s efforts to buy the hotel as \u2018fighting for a seat on the Titanic.\u2019 But, Donald Trump says, \u2018I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, \u2018How bad can this be?\u201d He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. \u2018If the seller was Italian,\u2019 says Mr. Trump, \u2018we sent an Italian\u2019 \u2013 something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.\u2018It\u2019s in his genes,\u2019 says Fred Trump, explaining his son\u2019s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.\u2018Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,\u2019 says Mr. Fischer. \u2018We\u2019ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.\u2019His success also derives from his marketing skills. \u2018I want to bring a",

What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise\u2026He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.AMLO\u2019s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico\u2019s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.Reported by 100percentfedup: Well\u2026at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what\u2019s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades.

So, AMLO\u2019s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.Read More",
        "Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, \u201cIn loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem\u2019s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y\u2019all.\u201dRelated: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich\u2019s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, \u201cThose who have suggested that Seth\u2019s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.\u201dSAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile\u2019s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich\u2019s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.\u201dBrazile had spoken publicly about Rich\u2019s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, \u201cSeth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth\u2019s legacy to his country and party is shameful.\u201d About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, \u201cSeth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.\u201dThrough spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, \u201cSince Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family\u2019s efforts to find Seth\u2019s killers.\u201dIn the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters seemed \u201cantiseptic, like a hospital,\u201d and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a \u201cslave.\u201d In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile\u2019s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, \u201cIt is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate\u2019s health.\u201dBrazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member.

Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth\u2014as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.4.

They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five\u2014Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years\u2014and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life\u2014including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California\u2014Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a \"new Democrat\" nor an \"old Democrat\" but a \"prehistoric Democrat.\" Other Republicans call her a \"latte Democrat\" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat\u2013around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics. To practice her penmanship, \"Little Nancy\" was in charge of the book in which her New Deal father kept track of favors done and owed.10.

On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of \"Scandal.\"On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best . She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady.Be Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media. The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trump's husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling. In March, the first lady addressed the criticism she has faced by taking up the issue during opening remarks to a meeting she convened at the White House for tech industry leaders from Google, Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others.JUST WATCHED Melania Trump's popularity jumps in new poll Replay More Videos ...

        "WITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London\u2019s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. \u201cWe do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,\u201d Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:\u201cThe new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.\u201d\u201cIt means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.\u201dMillions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don\u2019t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:\u201cThere is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists \u2013 and even \u201cmoderate\u201d Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.\u201dYes, that\u2019s right\u2014because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow \u201cintolerant.\u201d Well do you know what most Americans think?You\u2019re damn right it\u2019s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500\u2019s AD? We shouldn\u2019t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is \u201cunfair,\u201d and \u201cdiscriminates,\u201d against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there\u20146th safest in the world, to be exact.\u201cAlthough Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.\u201dAfter the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.",
        "SHARE this story with your friends!10.3k SHARES Share Tweet ShareWhen Donald Trump hinted that he may end aid to Puerto Rico over the mayor of San Juan\u2019s decision to withhold aid from the rest of the country, the city\u2019s other leaders finally took action.While Puerto Rico\u2019s Governor has praised Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to quell the suffering of the people affected by Hurricane Maria, many of those efforts have been in vain because supplies come into San Juan, and the mayor has been stingy with distribution.\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have the staff or resources to distribute countrywide,\u201d Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told a local newspaper, adding that \u201canyone can come to San Juan if they need supplies.\u201dUnfortunately, that explanation was not good enough for her peers. In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren\u2019t even required to give them.",
        "San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz\u2019s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president \u2014 and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the \u201cblame Trump\u201d narrative.As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA\u2019s actions.\u201cWhat is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,\u201d Yul\u00edn Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled \u201cNASTY\u201d \u2014 where did she get it during a major storm? \u2014 as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. \u201cWe are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,\u201d she said during a television conference in early October.Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of \u201cinefficiency and bureaucracy\u201d in Puerto Rico \u2026 but it looks like the island\u2019s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.\u201cThe suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,\u201d the AP reported.\u201cU.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town\u2019s public employees and municipal contractors,\u201d the newswire continued.\u201cNot only is that illegal, it\u2019s immoral,\u201d Rodriguez added.Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz V\u00e9lez, who served as mayor. Ortiz V\u00e9lez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.\u201cRodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,\u201d the AP confirmed.The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.However, it\u2019s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn\u2019t point to Donald Trump \u2026 it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.",
        "Living in regular-sized homes with plenty of space for closets, lockers and shelves gives us little need to think about storage space. In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn\u2019t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can\u2019t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn\u2019t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don\u2019t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn\u2019t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can\u2019t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers."
